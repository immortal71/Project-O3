## SLIDE 1: TITLE
**OncoPurpose**  
*Democratizing Oncology Drug Repurposing for India*

Team: [Your Name]  
Contact: [Your Email]  
Seeking: Pre-seed ₹50L-2Cr

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Oncology Drug Development is Broken for Small Players

**The Reality:**
- New cancer drug: $2.6B, 10-15 years
- Small oncology centers can't afford R&D
- India has 1,000+ oncology centers, most lack research capacity
- Existing drugs sitting unused while cancer burden grows

**The Opportunity:**
- 1,400+ FDA-approved drugs
- Most tested for single indication
- Hidden potential for cancer treatment
- **Drug repurposing: 3-5 years, $300M** (vs. $2.6B, 15 years)

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

### AI-Powered Drug Repurposing Platform

**What We Do:**
Analyze approved drugs against cancer types to find hidden opportunities

**How It Works:**
1. Input: Drug name OR cancer type
2. Analysis: Multi-source evidence (trials, publications, mechanisms)
3. Output: Prioritized candidates with confidence scores

**Why It Matters:**
- Small centers can find repurposing opportunities
- Faster time to clinical validation
- Lower risk (drugs already safety-tested)
- Massive cost savings

## BACKUP SLIDES: INVESTOR Q&A

### Q: "What if big pharma does this?"

**A:** They won't - it's not worth their time.
- Big pharma targets blockbuster drugs ($1B+ revenue)
- Repurposing generics = low margin
- Our customers (small pharma, researchers) aren't their customers
- We're a tool, not a drug developer

---

### Q: "How defensible is this?"

**A:** Multi-layer moat:
1. **Data curation**: We're building the best oncology-specific dataset
2. **Domain expertise**: Not just tech - we understand oncology workflows
3. **Network effects**: More users → more validation → better data
4. **Brand**: "Go-to platform" for oncology repurposing in India

---

### Q: "Why hasn't this been done?"

**A:** It's being done globally, but:
- Existing tools are academic (not commercial)
- US/Europe tools are expensive for Indian market
- No one's focused on Indian oncology centers
- We combine beautiful UI + credible data + Indian pricing

---

### Q: "What's the exit strategy?"

**A:** Multiple paths:
1. **Acquisition** by larger healthtech platform (5-7 years, ₹50-100 Cr)
2. **Acquisition** by pharma data company (DrugBank, Cortellis)
3. **Strategic** partnership with big pharma (licensing)
4. **Continue building** to profitability and beyond

**Comparable exits:**
- BenevolentAI (UK, drug discovery AI): $2B valuation
- Recursion Pharma (US, drug repurposing): $1.5B IPO
- Healx (UK, rare disease repurposing): $100M+ raised
