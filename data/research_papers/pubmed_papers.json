      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly heterogeneous cancer and exploring novel therapeutic options is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. Here, we established human CRC tumor-derived organoids that well represent both morphological and molecular heterogeneities of original tumors. To efficiently identify repurposed drugs for CRC, we developed a robust organoid-based drug screening system. By combining the repurposed drug library and computation-based drug prediction, 335 drugs were tested and 34 drugs with anti-CRC effects were identified. More importantly, we conducted a detailed transcriptome analysis of drug responses and divided the drug response signatures into five representative patterns: differentiation induction, growth inhibition, metabolism inhibition, immune response promotion, and cell cycle inhibition. The anticancer activities of drug candidates were further validated in the established patient-derived organoids-based xenograft (PDOX) system in vivo. We found that...",

      "abstract": "Knowledge of the underpinnings of cancer initiation, progression and metastasis has increased exponentially in recent years. Advanced \"omics\" coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence (deep learning) methods have helped elucidate targets and pathways critical to those processes that may be amenable to pharmacologic modulation. However, the current anti-cancer therapeutic armamentarium continues to lag behind. As the cost of developing a new drug remains prohibitively expensive, repurposing of existing approved and investigational drugs is sought after given known safety profiles and reduction in the cost barrier. Notably, successes in oncologic drug repurposing have been infrequent. Computational in-silico strategies have been developed to aid in modeling biological processes to find new disease-relevant targets and discovering novel drug-target and drug-phenotype associations. Machine and deep learning methods have especially enabled leaps in those successes. This revi...",

      "abstract": "Cancer neuroscience, as an emerging converging discipline, provides us with new perspectives on the interactions between the nervous system and cancer progression. As the sympathetic nervous system, in particular adrenergic signaling, plays an important role in the regulation of tumor activity at every hierarchical level of life, from the tumor cell to the tumor microenvironment, and to the tumor macroenvironment, it is highly desirable to dissect its effects. Considering the far-reaching implications of drug repurposing for antitumor drug development, such a large number of adrenergic receptor antagonists on the market has great potential as one of the means of antitumor therapy, either as primary or adjuvant therapy. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the impact of adrenergic signaling on cancer development and to assess the status and prospects of intervening in adrenergic signaling as a therapeutic tool against tumors.",

      "abstract": "Cancer, a complex and multifactorial disease, presents a significant challenge to global health. Despite significant advances in surgical, radiotherapeutic and immunological approaches, which have improved cancer treatment outcomes, drug therapy continues to serve as a key therapeutic strategy. However, the clinical efficacy of drug therapy is often constrained by drug resistance and severe toxic side effects, and thus there remains a critical need to develop novel cancer therapeutics. One promising strategy that has received widespread attention in recent years is drug repurposing: the identification of new applications for existing, clinically approved drugs. Drug repurposing possesses several inherent advantages in the context of cancer treatment since repurposed drugs are typically cost-effective, proven to be safe, and can significantly expedite the drug development process due to their already established safety profiles. In light of this, the present review offers a comprehensiv...",

Over the past two decades, the polytrophic, pharmacological, and biochemical properties of BBR have been intensively studied. The key functions of BBR, including anti-inflammation, antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-obesity, and even antitumor, have been discovered. However, the underlying mechanisms of BBR-mediated regulation still need to be explored. Given that BBR is also a natural nutrition supplement, the modulatory effects of BBR on nutritional immune responses have attracted more attention from investigators. In this mini-review, we summarized the latest achievements of BBR on inflammation, gut microbes, macrophage polarization, and immune responses associated with their possible tools in the pathogenesis and therapy of ulcerative colitis and cancer in recent 5 years. We also discuss the therapeutic efficacy and anti-inflammatory actions of BBR to ben...",

      "abstract": "Malaria is an ancient infectious disease that threatens millions of lives globally even today. The discovery of artemisinin, inspired by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has brought in a paradigm shift and been recognized as the \"best hope for the treatment of malaria\" by World Health Organization. With its high potency and low toxicity, the wide use of artemisinin effectively treats the otherwise drug-resistant parasites and helps many countries, including China, to eventually eradicate malaria. Here, we will first review the initial discovery of artemisinin, an extraordinary journey that was in stark contrast with many drugs in western medicine. We will then discuss how artemisinin and its derivatives could be repurposed to treat cancer, inflammation, immunoregulation-related diseases, and COVID-19. Finally, we will discuss the implications of the \"artemisinin story\" and how that can better guide the development of TCM today. We believe that artemisinin is just a starting point an...",

      "abstract": "As competitive HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, statins not only reduce cholesterol and improve cardiovascular risk, but also exhibit pleiotropic effects that are independent of their lipid-lowering effects. Among them, the anti-cancer properties of statins have attracted much attention and indicated the potential of statins as repurposed drugs for the treatment of cancer. A large number of clinical and epidemiological studies have described the anticancer properties of statins, but the evidence for anticancer effectiveness of statins is inconsistent. It may be that certain molecular subtypes of cancer are more vulnerable to statin therapy than others. Whether statins have clinical anticancer effects is still an active area of research. Statins appear to enhance the efficacy and address the shortcomings associated with conventional cancer treatments, suggesting that statins should be considered in the context of combined therapies for cancer.

Here, we use a drug-repurposing library to screen PDOs of colorectal cancer (CRC) to identify hidden vulnerabilities within therapy-induced phenotypes. Using a microscopy-based screen that accurately scores drug-induced cell killing, we have tested 414 putative anti-cancer drugs for their ability to switch the EGFRi/MEKi-induced cytostatic phenotype toward cytotoxicity. A majority of validated hits (9/37) are microtubule-targeting agents that are commonly used in clinical oncology, such as taxanes and vinca-alkaloids. One of these drugs, vinorelbine, is consistently effective across a panel of >25 different CRC PDOs, independent of RAS mutational status. Unlike vinorelbine alone, its combination with EGFR/MEK inhibition induces apoptosis at all stages of the cell cycle and shows tolerability and effective anti-tumor activity in vivo, setting the basis for a clinical t...",

However, divergences exist regarding its employed doses in preclinical works. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the antitumor effects of ivermectin are observable at clinically feasible drug concentrations. Twenty-eight malignant cell lines were treated with 5 μM ivermectin. Cell viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle, cell death and pharmacological interaction with common cytotoxic drugs were assessed, as well as the consequences of its use on stem cell-enriched populations. The antitumor in vivo effects of ivermectin were also evaluated. The breast MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7, and the ovarian SKOV-3, were the most sensitive cancer cell lines to ivermectin. Conversely, the prostate cancer cell line DU145 was the most resistant to its use. In the most sensitive cells, ivermectin induced cell cycle arres...",

In the present study, we investigated patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTO) and matched tumor tissues from surgically treated patients with NSCLC to identify drug repurposing targets to overcome resistance toward standard-of-care platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. PDTOs were established from 10 prospectively enrolled patients with non-metastatic NSCLC from resected tumors. PDTOs were compared with matched tumor tissues by histopathology/immunohistochemistry, whole exome sequencing, and transcriptome sequencing. PDTO growths and drug responses were determined by measuring 3D tumoroid volumes, cell viability, and proliferation/apoptosis. Differential gene expression analysis identified drug-repurposing targets. Validations were performed with internal/external data sets of patients with NSCLC. NSCLC cell lines were used for aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) knoc...",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a major health issue worldwide, and the global burden of cancer is expected to increase in the coming years. Whereas the limited success with current therapies has driven huge investments into drug development, the average number of FDA approvals per year has declined since the 1990s. This unmet need for more effective anti-cancer drugs has sparked a growing interest for drug repurposing, i.e. using drugs already approved for other indications to treat cancer. As such, data both from pre-clinical experiments, clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy for compounds within a wide range of drug classes other than cancer. Whereas some of them induce cancer cell death or suppress various aspects of cancer cell behavior in established tumors, others may prevent cancer development.

Oncology terms such as big killers - to identify tumours with yet a high mortality rate - or undruggable cancer targets, and chemoresistance, represent the current therapeutic debacle of cancer treatments. In addition, metastases, tumour microenvironments, tumour heterogeneity, metabolic adaptations, and immunotherapy resistance are essential features controlling tumour response to therapies, but still, lack effective therapeutics or modulators. In this scenario, where the pharmaceutical productivity and drug efficacy in oncology seem to have reached a plateau, the so-called drug repurposing - i.e. the use of old drugs, already in clinical use, for a different therapeutic indication - is an appealing strategy to improve cancer therapy.

Such drug repurposing promises faster access of drugs to patients while reducing costs in the long and difficult process of drug development. However, the number of existing drugs and diseases, together with the heterogeneity of patients and diseases, notably including cancers, can make repurposing time consuming and inefficient. The key question we address is how to efficiently repurpose an existing drug to treat a given indication. As drug efficacy remains the main bottleneck for overall success, we discuss the need for machine-learning computational methods in combination with specific phenotypic studies along with mechanistic studies, chemical genetics and omics assays to successfully predict disease-drug pairs. Such a pipeline could be particularly important to cancer patients who face heterogeneous, recurrent and metastatic disease and need...",

Currently, the gold standard treatment is transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-Bt) accompanied by intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillation for patients with middle-to-high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, intravesical BCG therapy fails in almost 50% of high risk cases, leading to NMIBC persistence or early recurrence. In these patients, the gold standard remains radical cystectomy; however, it can seriously affect the patients' quality of life. Moreover, for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), the 5-year survival rate after radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains low.

Unfortunately, there are currently no approved drugs specifically designed to treat multidrug-resistant cancers, making MDR a significant obstacle to successful chemotherapy. Despite over two decades of research, developing transporter-specific inhibitors for clinical use has proven to be a challenging endeavor. As an alternative approach, drug repurposing has gained traction as a more practical method to discover clinically effective modulators of drug transporters. This involves exploring new indications for already-approved drugs, bypassing the lengthy process of developing novel synthetic inhibitors. In this context, we will discuss the mechanisms of ABC drug transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, their roles in cancer MDR, and the inhibitors that have been evaluated for their potential to reverse MDR mediated by these drug transpor...",

      "abstract": "Repurposing antifungal drugs in cancer therapy has attracted unprecedented attention in both preclinical and clinical research due to specific advantages, such as safety, high-cost effectiveness and time savings compared with cancer drug discovery. The surprising and encouraging efficacy of antifungal drugs in cancer therapy, mechanistically, is attributed to the overlapping targets or molecular pathways between fungal and cancer pathogenesis. Advancements in omics, informatics and analytical technology have led to the discovery of increasing \"off-site\" targets from antifungal drugs involved in cancerogenesis, such as smoothened (D477G) inhibition from itraconazole in basal cell carcinoma. This review illustrates several antifungal drugs repurposed for cancer therapy and reveals the underlying mechanism based on their original target and \"off-site\" target. Furthermore, the challenges and perspectives for the future development and clinical applications of antifungal drugs for cancer th...",

Understanding of the mechanisms underlying ASD remains limited, and treatments are lacking. Genetic diversity complicates drug development. Given the complexity and severity of ASD symptoms and the rising number of diagnoses, exploring novel therapeutic strategies is essential. Here, we focus on shared molecular pathways between ASD and cancer and highlight recent progress on the repurposing of cancer drugs for ASD treatment, such as mTOR inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents. We discuss how to improve trial design considering drug dose and patient age. Lastly, the discussion explores the critical aspects of side effects, commercial factors, and the efficiency of drug-screening pipelines; all of which are essential considerations in the pursuit of repurposing cancer drugs for addressing core features of ASD.",

Drug repurposing is one of the established approaches to reposition old, clinically approved off-patent noncancer drugs with known targets into newer indications. The literature review suggests a key role of drug repurposing in the development of drugs intended for cancer as well as noncancer therapeutics. A wide category of noncancer drugs such as, drugs acting on CNS, anthelmintics, cardiovascular drugs, antimalarial drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, have come out with interesting outcomes during preclinical and clinical phases. In the present article, a comprehensive overview of the current scenario of drug repurposing for the treatment of cancer has been focused.

Since the distinct set of cancer driver genes can vary between and within cancer types, evidence-based selection of drugs is crucial for targeted therapy following the precision medicine paradigm. However, many putative cancer driver genes can not be targeted directly, suggesting an indirect approach that considers alternative functionally related targets in the gene interaction network. Once potential drug targets have been identified, it is essential to consider all available drugs. Since tools that offer support for systematic discovery of drug repurposing candidates in oncology are lacking, we developed CADDIE, a web application integrating six human gene-gene and four drug-gene interaction databases, information regarding cancer driver genes, cancer-type specific mutation frequencies, gene expression information, ge...",

Moreover, integrative analyses that provide novel insights into disease biology are expected to be especially useful for drug discovery. Herein, we used text mining of genetic studies on colorectal cancer (CRC) and assigned biological annotations to identified risk genes in order to discover novel drug targets and potential drugs for repurposing. Risk genes for CRC were obtained from PubMed text mining, and for each gene, six functional and bioinformatic annotations were analyzed. The annotations include missense mutations, cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), molecular pathway analyses, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), a genetic overlap with knockout mouse phenotypes, and primary immunodeficiency (PID).

A series of remarkable achievements in this field comes with the practical applications of in silico approaches including transcriptomic signature matching, gene-connection-based scanning, and simulated structure docking in repositioning drug therapies against breast cancer.

Furthermore, we provide suggestions to further utilize the potential of drug repurposing within precision oncology, with a focus on combinatorial approaches. Oncologic drug development is a timely and costly endeavor, with only few compounds progressing to meaningful therapy options.

Resistance to current treatments, especially in FLT3-ITD AML cases, urgently demands the development of novel therapeutics. In this study, we pinpointed fostamatinib, an orally delivered small molecule SYK inhibitor for chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), as a promising candidate for drug repurposing. It effectively inhibited FLT3-ITD+ AML cell proliferation and induced leukemic cell apoptosis. Network pharmacology analysis further deciphered the associated pharmacological mechanism related to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, fostamatinib downregulated the expression of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 and CD47.

      "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drug classes with wide therapeutic applications over the centuries. Starting from the use of salicylate-containing willow leaves to the recent rise and fall of highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and the latest dual-acting anti-inflammatory molecules, they have displayed a rapid and ongoing evolution. Despite the enormous advances in the last twenty years, investigators are still in search of the design and development of more potent and safer therapy against inflammatory conditions. This challenge has been increasingly attractive as the emergence of inflammation as a common seed and unifying mechanism for most chronic diseases. Indeed, this fact put the NSAIDs in the spotlight for repurposing against inflammation-related disorders. This review attempts to present a historical perspective on the evolution of NSAIDs, regarding their COX-dependent/independent mode of actions, structu...",

      "abstract": "Sex differences are essential factors in disease etiology and manifestation in many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration [33]. The biological influence of sex differences (including genomic, epigenetic, hormonal, immunological, and metabolic differences between males and females) and the lack of biomedical studies considering sex differences in their study design has led to several policies. For example, the National Institute of Health's (NIH) sex as a biological variable (SABV) and Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) policies to motivate researchers to consider sex differences [204]. However, drug repurposing, a promising alternative to traditional drug discovery by identifying novel uses for FDA-approved drugs, lacks sex-aware methods that can improve the identification of drugs that have sex-specific responses [7, 11, 14, 33]. Sex-aware drug repurposing methods either select drug candidates that are more efficacious in one sex or deprioritize...",

      "abstract": "Quinacrine, also known as mepacrine, has originally been used as an antimalarial drug for close to a century, but was recently rediscovered as an anticancer agent. The mechanisms of anticancer effects of quinacrine are not well understood. The anticancer potential of quinacrine was discovered in a screen for small molecule activators of p53, and was specifically shown to inhibit NFκB suppression of p53. However, quinacrine can cause cell death in cells that lack p53 or have p53 mutations, which is a common occurrence in many malignant tumors including high grade serous ovarian cancer. Recent reports suggest quinacrine may inhibit cancer cell growth through multiple mechanisms including regulating autophagy, FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) chromatin trapping, and the DNA repair process. Additional reports also suggest quinacrine is effective against chemoresistant gynecologic cancer. In this review, we discuss anticancer effects of quinacrine and potential mechanisms of actio...",

Drug repurposing is a viable option fordeveloping novel medical treatment strategies since this method is more cost-efficient and rapid. Antihypertensive medicines have recently been found to have pharmacological features that could be used to treat cancer, making them effective candidates for therapeutic repurposing. The goal of our research is to find a potent antihypertensive drug that can be repurposed as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In this study, virtual screening was performed using a set of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antihypertensive drugs as ligands with selected receptor proteins (EGFR, KRAS, P53, AGTR1, AGTR2, and ACE) assuming these proteins are regarded to have a significant role in hypertension as well as breast cancer. Further, our in-silico results were further confirmed by an in-vitro experiment (cytotoxicity assay). All the compounds (enalapril, atenolol...",

      "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer. Several million people are estimated to have affected with this condition worldwide. Skin cancer generally includes melanoma and non-melanoma with the former being the most dangerous. Chemotherapy has been one of the key therapeutic strategies employed in the treatment of skin cancer, especially in advanced stages of the disease. It could be also used as an adjuvant with other treatment modalities depending on the type of skin cancer. However, there are several shortfalls associated with the use of chemotherapy such as non-selectivity, tumour resistance, life-threatening toxicities, and the exorbitant cost of medicines. Furthermore, new drug discovery is a lengthy and costly process with minimal likelihood of success. Thus, drug repurposing (DR) has emerged as a new avenue where the drug approved formerly for the treatment of one disease can be used for the treatment of another disease like cancer. This approach is greatly benefici...",

Drug repurposing is an economically efficient approach that entails discovering novel therapeutic applications for already-available medications. Genomics enables the identification of illness and therapeutic molecular characteristics and interactions, which in turn facilitates the process of drug repurposing. Techniques like gene expression profiling and Mendelian randomization are helpful in identifying possible medication candidates. Progress in computer science allows for the investigation and modeling of gene expression networks that involve large amounts of data. The amalgamation of data concerning DNA, RNA, and protein functions bears similarity to pharmacogenomics, a crucial aspect in crafting cancer therapeutics.

We have identified and analyzed international disclosures concerning drug repurposing for cancer that were published under the Patent Convention Treaty during the past five years, and show this burgeoning field from an angle that is not routinely captured in review papers of the field. We find that patenting activity for cancer-related new uses for known compounds has been quite constant recently and has targeted mainly small molecule active ingredients that are currently marketed as drugs. Universities contributed most applications, closely followed by corporations. The strong representation of non-academic research institutes from the public and private sector and foundations was surprising and indicates that drug repurposing for cancer has transcended the ...",

While conventional drug development is a lengthy and expensive process, drug repurposing is a faster, alternate approach, where an existing drug, not meant for treating cancer, can be repurposed to treat retinoblastoma.

This review explores the intricate connections between metabolic syndrome, enhanced glycolysis, and altered lipid metabolism within OC cells, which fuel the aggressive nature of the disease. We discuss how metabolic pathways are rewired in OC to support uncontrolled cell proliferation, survival under hypoxic conditions, and evasion of cell death mechanisms, positioning metabolic alterations as central to disease progression.

With an increased understanding of the hallmarks of cancer and the development of various data-driven approaches, drug repurposing further promotes the holistic productivity of drug discovery and reasonably focuses on target-defined antineoplastic compounds.

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men. Common treatments include active surveillance, surgery, or radiation. Androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy are usually reserved for advanced disease or biochemical recurrence, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but they are not considered curative because PCa cells eventually develop drug resistance. The latter is achieved through various cellular mechanisms that ultimately circumvent the pharmaceutical's mode of action. The need for novel therapeutic approaches is necessary under these circumstances. An alternative way to treat PCa is by repurposing of existing drugs that were initially intended for other conditions. By extrapolating the effects of previously approved drugs to the intracellular processes of PCa, treatment options will expand. In addition, drug repurposing is cost-effective and efficient because it utilizes drugs that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy. This review cata...",

There are various computational methods for drug repurposing, one of which is using transcription signatures, especially single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which show us a clear and comprehensive view of the inside of the cell to compare the state of disease and health. In this study, we used 91,103 scRNA-seq samples from 29 patients with colorectal cancer (GSE144735 and GSE132465). First, differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was done using the ASAP website. Then we reached a list of drugs that can reverse the gene signature pattern from cancer to normal using the iLINCS website. Further, by searching various databases and articles, we found 12 drugs that have FDA approval, and so far, no one has reported them as a drug in the treatment of any cancer.

Many strategies have been developed in drug discovery pipelines to help rectify this problem and two of the best ones are drug repurposing and computational methods. The combination of these approaches can have immense impact on the course of drug discovery. In silico drug repurposing can significantly reduce the time, the cost and the effort of drug development. Computational methods such as structure-based drug design (SBDD) and virtual screening can predict the potentials of small molecule binders, such as drugs, for having favorable effect on a particular molecular target. However, the demand for accuracy and efficiency of SBDD requires more sophisticated and complicated approaches such as unbiased molecular dynamics (UMD) simulation that has been recently introduced. As a complementary strategy, the knowledge acquired from UMD simulations can increase the chance of finding the right candidates and the pipe...",

Three compounds induced oxidative DNA damage in cancer cells with subsequent cellular apoptosis.

The DNA damage induced by these compounds, demonstrated by pATM nuclear shuttling, was comparable in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (p53 mutant) cell lines.

The most prevalent type of cancer in women, worldwide, is breast cancer, a type of cancer associated with a huge death rate. This high mortality is mainly a consequence of the development of drug resistance, which is one of the major challenges to overcome in breast cancer treatment. As a result, research has been focused on finding novel therapeutical weapons, specifically ones that allow for a personalized treatment, based on patients' characteristics. Although the scientific community has been concerned about guaranteeing the quality of life of cancer patients, researchers are also aware of the increasing costs related to cancer treatment, and efforts have been made to find alternatives to the development of new drugs.

This review described a total of 10 kinds of non-oncological drugs from more than 100 mechanical studies as well as evidence from population-based studies. The future direction of repurposed drug screening is discussed by using patient-derived tumor organoids. Many old drugs showed previously unknown effects or off-target effects and can be intelligently applied for cancer chemoprevention and therapy. The identification of repurposed drugs needs to combine evidence from mechanical studies and population-based studies. Due to the heterogeneity of cancer, patient-derived tumor organoids can be used to screen the non-oncological drugs in vitro.

      "abstract": "Personalized medicine has emerged as a revolutionary approach to healthcare in the 21st century. By understanding a patient's unique genetic and biological characteristics, it aims to tailor treatments specifically to the individual. This approach takes into account factors such as an individual's lifestyle, genetic makeup, and environmental factors to provide targeted therapies that have the potential to be more effective and lower the risk of side reactions or ineffective treatments. It is a paradigm shift from the traditional \"one size fits all\" approach in medicine, where patients with similar symptoms or diagnoses receive the same standard treatments regardless of their differences. It leads to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient use of healthcare resources. Drug repurposing is a strategy that uses existing drugs for new indications and aims to take advantage of the known safety profiles, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action of these drugs to accelerate the develop...",

Drug repurposing (DR) has shown great potential against BC by overcoming major shortcomings of approved anticancer therapeutics. However, poor physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic performance, stability, non-selectivity to tumors, and side effects are severe hurdles in repurposed drug delivery against BC. The variety of nanocarriers (NCs) has shown great promise in delivering repurposed therapeutics for effective treatment of BC via improving solubility, stability, tumor selectivity and reducing toxicity. Besides, delivering repurposed cargos via theranostic NCs can be helpful in the quick diagnosis and treatment of BC. Localized delivery of repurposed candidates through apt NCs can diminish the systemic side effects and improve anti-tumor effectiveness. However, breast tumor variability and tumor microenvironment have created several challenges to nanoparticulate delivery of repurposed car...",

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of drug repurposing of medications already in use. We conducted a narrative review of current evidence and ongoing research on drug repurposing of SRIs, with a focus on immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and neuroprotective activity.

Currently available therapeutic strategies are based on surgical resection, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. However, majority of patients quickly develop therapeutic resistance and are often left with long-term therapy-related side effects and sequelae. Therefore, there remains a dire need to develop more effective therapeutics to overcome the acquired resistance to currently available therapies. Unfortunately, the process of developing novel anti-neoplastic drugs from bench to bedside is highly time-consuming and very expensive. A wide range of drugs that are already in clinical use for treating non-cancerous diseases might commonly target tumor-associated signaling pathways as well and hence be of interest in treating different cancers. This is referred to as drug repurposing or repositioning. In medulloblastoma, drug repurposing has recently gained a remarkable interest as an alternativ...",

The mainstay of treatment for most brain tumors includes surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However, resistance to conventional therapy is widespread, which contributes to the high mortality rates reported and lack of improvement in patient survival despite advancement in therapeutic research. This has been attributed to the presence of a subpopulation of cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), which reside within the tumor bulk and maintain self-renewal and recurrence potential of the tumor. An emerging promising approach that enables identifying novel therapeutic strategies to target CSCs and overcome therapy resistance is drug repurposing or repositioning.

The missense mutations belonged to 9 categories (ABC transporter, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell cycle, DNA damage, kinase, protease, transcription factor, tumor suppressor). The highest percentages of missense mutations were observed in transcription factor genes. The mutational profiles of all 35 tumors were subjected to hierarchical heatmap clustering. All 7 leukemia biopsies clustered together and were separated from solid tumors.

Hundreds of putative drug molecules of synthetic and natural origin were approved for anticancer therapy in the last few decades. Although conventional anticancer treatment strategies have promising aspects, several factors such as their limitations, drug resistance, and side effects associated with them demand more effort in repositioning or developing novel therapeutic regimens. The rich heritage of microbial bioactive components remains instrumental in providing novel avenues for cancer therapeutics. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and fungi have a plethora of bioactive compounds, which received attention for their efficacy in cancer treatment targeting different pathways responsible for abnormal cell growth and differentiation. Yet the full potential remains underexpl...",

Unfortunately, drug resistance remains a huge challenge in clinics, leading to invariable occurrence of disease progression after treatment initiation. While novel drug development is unfavorable in terms of time frame and costs, drug repurposing is one of the promising strategies to combat resistance. This approach refers to the application of clinically available drugs to treat a different disease. With the well-established safety profile and optimal dosing of these approved drugs, their combination with current cancer therapy is suggested to provide an economical, safe and efficacious approach to overcome drug resistance and prolong patient survival.

Due to large number of patients, efficient treatments for viral cancers are needed. De novo drug discovery is time consuming and expensive process with high failure rate in clinical stages. To address this problem and provide treatments to patients suffering from viral cancers faster, drug repurposing emerges as an effective alternative which aims to find the other indications of the Food and Drug Administration approved drugs. Applied to viral cancers, drug repurposing studies following the niche have tried to find if already existing drugs could be used to treat viral cancers.

An unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines in a manner predictable from the cell lines' molecular features. Our findings include compounds that killed by inducing PDE3A-SLFN12 complex formation; vanadium-containing compounds whose killing depended on the sulfate transporter SLC26A2; the alcohol dependence drug disulfiram, which killed cells with low expression of metallothioneins; and the anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin, which killed via the multi-drug resistance protein ABCB1.

It boasts the distinct advantages of an excellent safety and tolerability profile and high cost-effectiveness at less than one US dollar per daily dose. Epidemiological evidence reveals that metformin reduces the risk of cancer and decreases cancer-related mortality in patients with diabetes; however, the exact mechanisms are not well understood. Energy metabolism may be central to the mechanism of action. Based on altering whole-body energy metabolism or cellular state, metformin's modes of action can be divided into two broad, non-mutually exclusive categories: \"direct effects\", which induce a direct effect on cancer cells, independent of blood glucose and insulin levels, and \"indirect effects\" that arise from systemic metabolic changes depending on blood glucose and insulin levels.

Targeting cancer cell metabolism offers a unique therapeutic advantage, as it disrupts the bioenergetic and biosynthetic processes that sustain tumor growth, adaptation, and resistance to therapy. Specifically, we examine the mechanisms through which antidiabetic, cardiovascular, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and anthelmintic agents interfere with glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and mitochondrial bioenergetics-metabolic circuits central to CRC progression and recurrence.

Aiming to fill this gap, new benchmarking standards were developed to quantitatively evaluate drug retrieval performance. Investigations of potential factors influencing drug retrieval were conducted based on these standards. As a result, we determined an optimal approach for LINCS data-based therapeutic discovery. With this approach, homoharringtonine (HHT) was identified to be a candidate agent with potential therapeutic and preventive effects on liver cancer.

Patientdatasets were mainly downloaded from TCGA, CPTAC and GEO. We conducted downstream analysis by collecting metagenes and generated 42-gene subtype classifiers to elucidate biological pathways. Subsequently, scRNA, eRNA, methylation, mutation, and copy number variation were depicted from a phenotype perspective. Enhancing the clinical translatability of molecular subtypes, preclinical models including CMAP, CCLE, and GDSC were utilized for drug repositioning. Importantly, we verified the presence of previously described three phenotypes including bronchioid, neuroendocrine, and squamoid. Poor prognosis was seen in squamoid and neuroendocrine clusters for treatment-naive and immunotherapy populations. The neuroendocrine cluster was dominated by STK11 mutations and 14q13.3 amplifications, whose related methylated loci are pred...",

Repositioning has encountered obstacles due to generally insufficient single-agent clinical anticancer effects of licensed drugs and a subsequent reluctance by pharmaceutical companies to invest in phase III combination studies with them. Here we review potential machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) approaches for using real-world data (RWD) that could overcome the limitations of clinical trials and retrospective analyses. We outline a two-tiered filtering approach of identifying top-ranked drugs based on their drug-target binding affinity scores while considering their challenges and matching the top-ranked drugs with their top-ranked specific scenarios from among the multitude of real-world scenarios for efficacy and safety. This approach will generate RWD scen...",

Although standard chemotherapy is the established treatment for ovarian cancer, the prognosis remains poor, and it is highly anticipated that new drugs will be developed. New drugs, such as humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibodies and poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, are expected to improve clinical outcomes of ovarian cancer. However, long-term, costly research is required to develop such new drugs, and soaring national healthcare costs are becoming a concern worldwide. In this social context, drug repositioning, wherein existing drugs are used to develop drugs with new indications for other diseases, has recently gained attention. Because trials have already confirmed the safety in humans and the pharmacokinetics of such drugs, the development period is shorter than the conventional development of a new drug, thereby reducing costs.

Niclosamide, present in the Model List of Essential Medicines, from the World Health Organization, has been used since the 1960s for tapeworm infection. Several preclinical studies have been shown its impressive anticancer effects, which led to clinical trials for colon and prostate cancer. Despite high expectations, proof of efficacy and safety are still required, which are associated with diverse biopharmaceutical challenges, such as the physicochemical properties of the drug and its oral absorption, and their relationship with clinical outcomes. Nanostructured systems are innovative drug delivery strategies, which may provide interesting pharmaceutical advantages for this candidate.

Through the use of outstanding bioinformatics tools, such as computer-aided drug design (CADD), computer strategies play a vital role in the re-transformation of drugs. The use of CADD's special strategy for target-based drug reuse is the most promising method, and its realization rate is high. In this review article, we have particularly focused on understanding the various technologies of CADD and the use of computer-aided drug design for target-based drug reuse, taking COVID-19 and cancer as examples. Finally, it is concluded that CADD technology is accelerating the development of repurposed drugs due to its many advantages, and there are many facts to prove that the new ligand-targeting strategy is a beneficial method and that it will gain momentum with the development of technology.",

      "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain metastases, continue to be an unmet medical challenge. Despite advances in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, tumor cell colonization in the central nervous system renders most treatment options ineffective. This is primarily due to the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which hinders the crossing of targeting agents into the brain. As such, repositioning medications that demonstrate anticancer effects and possess the ability to cross the BBB can be a promising option. Antidepressants, which are BBB-permeable, have been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Autophagy, specifically, has been identified as one of the common key mediators of antidepressant's antitumor effects. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antidepressants with reported cytotoxic activities in different tumor models, where autophagy dysregulati...",

The first examples of repurposed drugs were discovered serendipitously, however data accumulated by high-throughput screenings and advancements in computational biology methods have paved the way for rational drug repositioning methods. As chemotherapeutic agents have notorious side effects that significantly reduce quality of life, drug repositioning promises repurposed noncancer drugs with little or tolerable adverse effects for cancer patients. Here, we review current drug-related data types and databases including some examples of web-based drug repositioning tools. Next, we describe systems biology approaches to be used in drug repositioning for effective cancer therapy.

      "abstract": "Methadone, which is used as maintenance medication for outpatient treatment of opioid dependence or as an analgesic drug, has been suggested by preclinical in vitro and mouse studies to induce cell death and sensitivity to chemo- or radiotherapy in leukemia, glioblastoma, and carcinoma cells. These data together with episodical public reports on long-term surviving cancer patients who use methadone led to a hype of methadone as an anti-cancer drug in social and public media. However, clinical evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone is missing and prospective clinical trials, except in colorectal cancer, are not envisaged because of the limited preclinical data available. The present article reviews the pharmacokinetics, potential molecular targets, as well as the evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone in view of the therapeutically achievable doses in the brain. Moreover, it provides original in vitro data showing that methadone at clinically relevant concentrations fail...",

Meanwhile, network-based computational biology approaches, which allow the integration of information from different aspects to understand the relationships between biomolecules, has been successfully applied to drug repurposing. In this work, we developed a new strategy for network-based drug repositioning against cancer. Combining the mechanism of action and clinical efficacy of the drugs, a cancer-related drug similarity network was constructed, and the correlation score of each drug with a specific cancer was quantified. The top 5% of scoring drugs were reviewed for stability and druggable potential to identify potential repositionable drugs. Of the 11 potentially repurposable drugs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 were confirmed by clinical trial articles and...",

Despite major research aimed at discovering and developing novel and effective anticancer drugs, oncology drug development is a lengthy and costly process, with high attrition rates. Drug repositioning (DR, also referred to as drug repurposing), the process of finding new uses for approved noncancer drugs, has been gaining popularity in the past decade. DR has become a powerful alternative strategy for discovering and developing novel anticancer drug candidates from the existing approved drug space. Indeed, the availability of several large established libraries of clinical drugs and rapid advances in disease biology, genomics/transcriptomics/proteomics and bioinformatics has accelerated the pace of activity-based, literature-based and in silico DR, thereby improving safety and reducing costs. However, DR still faces financial obstacles in clinical trials, which could limit its practical use in the c...",

There is increasing evidence that in addition to their use in the treatment of mental disorders, antipsychotic, antidepressant, and mood-stabilizing drugs have clinical potential for cancer therapy. These drugs have been shown to inhibit the malignant progression of glioma by targeting signaling pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, or invasion/migration or by increasing the sensitivity of glioma cells to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

This research explores the complex relationship between p62 (also known as SQSTM1), a multifunctional protein central in cancer signaling pathways - especially the NF-κB pathway - and chemoresistance. Our data indicate that disruption of the interaction between p62 and the serine/threonine protein kinase RIP1 is a viable strategy to counteract NF-κB activation and overcome chemoresistance. Employing a comprehensive drug repositioning approach, we utilized bioinformatics tools to perform docking, virtual screening, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion analyses, toxicity analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify FDA-approved drugs that prevent the binding of p62 to RIP1. Notable candidates, particularly montelukast and asunaprevir, blocked the p62-RIP1 interaction, establishing a basis for potential therapeutic interventions against chemoresistant cancers.

Gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify the hub genes driving the tumor development. A profile-based drug repositioning approach was used to repurpose the potentially useful drugs for targeting the hub genes. MTT and LDH assay were used to measure the cell viability and drug cytotoxicity, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of the proteins. We identified 341 consistent prognostic genes from two independent LUAD cohorts, whose high expression was associated with poor survival outcomes of patients.

DR can play an important role in optimizing the pre-clinical process of developing novel drugs by saving time and cost compared with the process of de novo drug discovery. Although the number of publications related to DR has rapidly increased, most therapeutic approaches were reported for malignant tumors. Surgical resection represents the definitive treatment for benign tumors of the central nervous system (BTCNS). However, treatment options remain limited for surgery-, chemotherapy- and radiation-refractory BTCNS, as well as malignant tumors. Meningioma, pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET), and schwannoma are the most common BTCNS. The treatment strategy using DR may be applied for refractory BTCNS, such as Grade 2 meningiomas, neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis, and PitNETs with cavernous sinus invasion...",

In this mini-review we assess the progress and potential of drug polypharmacology in biomarker-driven precision oncology. Polypharmacology not only provides great opportunities for drug repurposing to exploit off-target effects in a new single-target indication but through simultaneous blockade of multiple targets or pathways offers exciting opportunities to slow, overcome or even prevent inherent or adaptive drug resistance. We highlight the many challenges associated with exploiting known or desired polypharmacology in drug design and development, and assess computational and experimental methods to uncover unk...",

Conventional drug development is often hindered by long timelines, high prices, and significant failure rates, making it unable to fulfil the rapidly increasing therapeutic demands. In this context, drug repurposing, identifying new therapeutic applications for existing medications with proven safety profiles, has emerged as a potential and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug discovery. Although numerous studies have explored the anticancer prospects of repurposed drugs, there exists a lack of systematic and cumulative knowledge regarding the varied therapeutic classes of interest for oncological purposes.

The pharmacological effects of thalidomide are attributed to its anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and modulatory effect on cytokines principally tumor necrosis factor-α, while the teratogenic effects are linked to two molecular targets, namely cereblon and tubulin. Teratogenicity is the gravest adverse effect of thalidomide depending on the dose and time of exposure. Nonetheless, with System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety program, the possibility of teratogenicity can be completely avoided. The sensitive period during pregnancy for thalidomide teratogenicity in humans is approximately 20-34 days after fertilization.

There are two major hurdles in anticancer drug development: dose-limiting toxic side effects that reduce either drug effectiveness or the quality of life of patients and complicated drug development processes that are costly and time consuming. Drug repositioning has recently gained increasing attention among cancer researchers as this approach utilizes existing drugs and is significantly cost- and time-effective. Existing drugs, particularly non-cancer drugs, have favorable safety profiles in humans and serve as an ever-increasing source for new anticancer drug discovery. Here we review the recent examples of drug repositioning of existing non-cancer drugs for preclinical and clinical introductions of cancer therapy.",

In recent decades, several new conventional therapies have been developed that have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with GBM. Nevertheless, most patients have a limited long-term response to these treatments and survive < 1 year. Therefore, innovative anti-cancer drugs that can be rapidly approved for patient use are urgently needed. One way to achieve accelerated approval is drug repositioning, extending the use of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes, as it takes less time to validate their biological activity as well as their safety in preclinical models. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of the literature search was performed to list drugs with antiviral, antiparasitic, and antidepressant properties that may be effective in GBM and their putative anti-tumor mechanisms in GBM cells.",

Finally, we performed a large-scale prediction of potential anticancer effects for all the drugs and experimentally validated the prediction results via three in vitro cellular assays that evaluate cell viability, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis induction. Using this strategy, we successfully identified several potential anticancer drugs. The proposed pathway-based method has great potential to improve drug repo...",

Such drug discovery can be performed at low cost and in the short term based on the results of previous clinical trials. New drugs for gynecologic tumors may be found by drug repositioning. For example, PPAR ligands may be effective against ovarian cancer, since PPAR activation eliminates COX-2 expression, arrests the cell cycle, and induces apoptosis. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, is effective for endometrial cancer through inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway by activating LKB1-AMPK and reduction of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 due to AMPK activation. COX-2 inhibitors for cervical cancer may also be examples of drug repositioning. PGE2 is induced in the arachidonate cascade by COX-2.

Results Among several potential compounds, we found that fludarabine (F-araA) and, to a lesser extent, risedronic acid (RIS) were cytotoxic in MPM cells, in comparison to the non-malignant Met-5A cells. In particular, F-araA reduced the proliferation and the colony formation ability of the MPM malignant cells, in comparison to the non-malignant control cells, as demonstrated by proliferation and colony formation assays, in addition to measurement of the phospho-ERK/total-ERK ratio.

      "abstract": "Cancer treatment represents an unmet challenge due to the development of drug resistance and severe side effects of chemotherapy. Artemisinin (ARS)-type compounds exhibit excellent antimalarial effects with few side effects and drug-resistance. ARS and its derivatives were also reported to act against various tumor types in vitro and in vivo, including acute leukemia. Therefore, ARS-type compounds may be exquisitely suitable for repurposing in leukemia treatment. To provide comprehensive clues of ARS and its derivatives for acute leukemia treatment, their molecular mechanisms are discussed in this review. Five monomeric molecules and 72 dimers, trimers and hybrids based on the ARS scaffold have been described against acute leukemia. The modes of action involve anti-angiogenic, anti-metastatic and growth inhibitory effects. These properties make ARS-type compounds as potential candidates for the treatment of acute leukemia. Still, more potent and target-selective ARS-type compounds need...",

Cisplatin is a primary chemotherapeutic agent utilized in combination with other drugs or radiotherapy for PDAC treatment. However, the severe side effects of cisplatin often necessitate discontinuation of therapy and drug resistance in tumor cells poses significant clinical challenges. Therefore, the development of effective therapeutic strategies is imperative. The present study investigated whether repositioning of the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole could sensitize the anticancer activity of cisplatin in pancreatic cancer at doses calculated by the combination index. The findings indicated that aripiprazole combined with cisplatin to suppress pancreatic cancer cell growth. Notably, the combination notably increased the expression of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase‑3, compared with cisplatin alone. Additionally, this combination effectively decreased XIAP and MCL‑1 expressio...",

However, new drug development is known to be a high-failure process because of the possibility of a lower efficacy than expected for the drug or appearance of non-manageable side effects. Another way to find alternative therapeutic drugs consists in identifying new applications for drugs already approved for a particular disease: a concept named \"drug repurposing\". In this context, several studies demonstrated the potential anti-tumour activity exerted by α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists and notably renewed interest for naftopidil as an anti-cancer drug. Naftopidil is used for benign prostatic hyperplasia management in Japan and a retrospective study brought out a reduced incidence of prostate cancer in patients that had been prescribed this drug. Further studies showed that naftopidil exerted anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects on pr...",

The mouse GSCs, 005, were differentiated into TDECs under hypoxic conditions, and TDECs had endothelial cell characteristics independent of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. In vivo, inhibition of the VEGF pathway had no anti-tumor effect and increased the percentage of TDECs in the 005 mouse model. Novel anti-angiogenic drugs for glioblastoma were evaluated using a tube formation assay and a drug repositioning strategy with existing blood-brain barrier permeable drugs.

In this overarching context, this expert review highlights the present unmet need for therapeutic innovations for pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs), also known as pituitary adenomas. Although there are many drugs used in practice to treat PitNETs, many of these drugs can have negative side effects and show highly variable outcomes in terms of overall recovery. Building innovation roadmaps for PitNETs' treatments can allow incorporation of systems biology approaches to bring about insights at multiple levels of cell biology, from genes to proteins to metabolites. Using the systems biology techniques, it will then be possible to offer potential therapeutic strategies for the convergence of preventive approaches and patient-centered disease treatment. ...",

It is a stage IV cancer disease with a poor prognosis, as the current therapeutic options (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) are not able to eradicate tumor cells. The approach to treat glioblastoma has not suffered major changes over the last decade and temozolomide (TMZ) remains the mainstay for chemotherapy. However, resistance mechanisms to TMZ and other chemotherapeutic agents are becoming more frequent. The lack of effective options is a reality that may be counterbalanced by repositioning known and commonly used drugs for other diseases. This approach takes into consideration the available pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, toxicity and safety data, and allows a much faster and less expensive drug and product development process.

In the search for new chemotherapeutics to treat malignant diseases, drug repurposing gained a tremendous interest during the past years. Repositioning candidates have often emerged through several stages of clinical drug development, and may even be marketed, thus attracting the attention and interest of pharmaceutical companies as well as regulatory agencies. Typically, drug repositioning has been serendipitous, using undesired side effects of small molecule drugs to exploit new disease indications. As bioinformatics gain increasing popularity as an integral component of drug discovery, more rational approaches are needed.

      "abstract": "Drug repositioning is a successful approach in medicinal research. It significantly simplifies the long-term process of clinical drug evaluation, since the drug being tested has already been approved for another condition. One example of drug repositioning involves cardiac glycosides (CGs), which have, for a long time, been used in heart medicine. Moreover, it has been known for decades that CGs also have great potential in cancer treatment and, thus, many clinical trials now evaluate their anticancer potential. Interestingly, heart failure and cancer are not the only conditions for which CGs could be effectively used. In recent years, the antiviral potential of CGs has been extensively studied, and with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this interest in CGs has increased even more. Therefore, here, we present CGs as potent and promising antiviral compounds, which can interfere with almost any steps of the viral life cycle, except for the viral attachment to a host cell.

      "abstract": "Fenbendazole is a benzimidazole anthelmintic agent commonly used to treat animal parasitic infections. In humans, other benzimidazoles, such as mebendazole and albendazole, are used as antiparasitic agents. Since fenbendazole is not currently approved by the FDA or EMA, its pharmacokinetics and safety in humans have yet to be well-documented in medical literature. Despite this, insights can be drawn from existing in vitro and in vivo animal studies on its pharmacokinetics. Given the low cost of fenbendazole, its high safety profile, accessibility, and unique anti-proliferative activities, fenbendazole would be the preferred benzimidazole compound to treat cancer. To ensure patient safety in the repurposing use of fenbendazole, it is crucial to perform clinical trials to assess its potential anticancer effects, optimal doses, therapeutic regimen, and tolerance profiles.

The Warburg hypothesis states that cancer cells have an altered cell metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis. Given this metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, it is possible to target cancers metabolically by depriving them of glucose. In addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications which work on tumors metabolically, there are a panoply of nutritional supplements and repurposed drugs associated with cancer prevention and better treatment outcomes. These interventions and their evidentiary basis are covered in the latter half of this review to guide future cancer treatment.",

Many clinical drugs consisting of small organic molecules have a short circulation half-life and do not effectively reach the diseased tissue site. This coupled with repeatedly high dose usage that leads to severe side effects. With the advance in nanotechnology, drugs contained within a nano-delivery device or drugs aggregated into nanoparticles (nano-drugs) have shown promises in targeted drug delivery. The ability to design nanoparticles to target bone has attracted many researchers to develop new systems for treating bone related diseases and even repurposing current drug therapies. In this review, we shall summarise the latest progress in this area and present a perspective for future development in the field.

Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs.

Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined drug-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia.

International guidelines provide recommendations for managing chemoradiotherapy-induced OM in various clinical contexts. Subsequently, emerging researches have introduced evidence supporting novel approaches or existing regimens for OM prevention and treatment. The repurposing of established drugs has garnered significant interest due to its shorter development timeline, improved safety profiles, and lower costs compared to new drug development. For example, clinical trials assessing established drugs such as melatonin, clonidine, and pentoxifylline indicate promising potential for managing OM. Additionally, several emerging pharmacological interventions have demonstrated considerable efficacy; SAMITAL and rhIL-11 are supported by phase II clinical...",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) is one of the leading causes of mortality accounting for almost 25% of cancer deaths throughout the world. The shortfall of affordable and effective first-line chemotherapeutics, the existence of resistant tumors, and the non-optimal route of administration contribute to poor prognosis and high mortality in LC. Administration of repurposed non-oncology drugs (RNODs) loaded in nanocarriers (NCs) via inhalation may prove as an effective alternative strategy to treat LC. Furthermore, their site-specific release through inhalation route using an appropriate inhalation device would offer improved therapeutic efficacy, thereby reducing mortality and improving patients' quality of life. The current manuscript offers a comprehensive overview on use of RNODs in LC treatment with an emphasis on their inhalation delivery and the associated challenges. The role of NCs to improve lung deposition and targeting of RNODs via inhalation are also elaborated. In addition, information abo...",

While children diagnosed with clinically stable NB experience a complete cure, those with high-risk disease (HR-NB) do not recover, despite intensive therapeutic strategies. Development of novel and effective targeted therapies is needed to counter disease progression, and to benefit long-term survival of children with HR-NB. Recent studies (2017-2020) pertinent to NB evolution are selectively reviewed to recognize novel and effective therapeutic targets. The prospective and promising therapeutic targets/strategies for HR-NB are categorized into (a) targeting oncogene-like and/or reinforcing tumor suppressor (TS)-like lncRNAs; (b) targeting oncogene-like microRNAs (miRs) and/or mimicking TS-miRs; (c) targets for immunotherapy; (d) targeting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells; (e) novel and beneficial combination approaches; and (f) repurposing drugs and other strat...",

Inhibiting the HIV protease impedes the virus from maturing and replicating. With this in mind, since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the research for already approved drugs (mainly antivirals) to repurpose for treatment of this disease has increased. Among the drugs tested, saquinavir showed promise in silico and in vitro in the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro). Another field for saquinavir repurposing has been in anticancer treatment, in which it has shown effects in vitro and in vivo in several types of cancer, from Kaposi carcinoma to neuroblastoma, demonstrating cytotoxicity, apoptosis, inhibition of cell invasion, and improvement of radiosensibility of cancer cells.

Findings from retrospective epidemiological studies in diabetic populations and preclinical laboratory models have demonstrated that biguanides possess antitumor activities that suggest their repurposing for cancer prevention and treatment. However, a better understanding of how these biguanides behave as antitumor agents is needed to guide their improved applications in cancer therapy, spurring increased interest in their pharmacology. Here, we present evidence for proposed mechanisms of action related to their antitumor activity, including their effects on central carbon metabolism in cancer cells and immune-modulating activity, and then review progress on biguanide repurposing in cancer therapeutics and the possible re-evaluation of phenformin as a cancer therapeutic agent.",

Nintedanib is also used for the treatment of several malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with Docetaxel, while Pirfenidone showed some anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical studies. On the other hand, novel targeted agents and immunotherapies have been introduced in the last decade for the treatment of NSCLC, and some of them showed anti-fibrotic properties in recent studies. These evidences, based on the common pathophysiological backgrounds of IPF and lung cancer, make possible the mutual or combined use of anti-fibrotic and anti-neoplastic drugs to treat these highly lethal diseases.

The amalgamation of anti-cancer drugs enhances efficacy compared to the mono-therapy approach because it targets key pathways in a characteristically synergistic or an additive manner. This approach potentially reduces drug resistance, while simultaneously providing therapeutic anti-cancer benefits, such as reducing tumour growth and metastatic potential, arresting mitotically active cells, reducing cancer stem cell populations, and inducing apoptosis. The 5-year survival rates for most metastatic cancers are still quite low, and the process of developing a new anti-cancer drug is costly and extremely time-consuming. Therefore, new strategies that target the survival pathways that provide efficient and effective results at an affordable cost are being considered. One such approach incorporates repurposing therapeutic agents initially used for the treatment of diff...",

Genetic mutations as well as environmental factors lead to the initiation, promotion, and progression of cancer.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression. A tumor is heterogeneous and composed of different cell types. CSCs are a subpopulation of tumor cells possessing abilities to self-renew and differentiate. The aim of this study was to present repurposed drugs, and potential candidates, that can serve as anticancer medications intended to target resistant cancer cells, i.e. CSCs.

Aging is a risk factor for both. Common environmental exposures, such as smoking, may play roles. Common mechanisms such as chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, and common risk factors such as diabetes and obesity, have been implicated.

At the molecular level, hypoxia is a major driving factor for tumour progression and aggressiveness. Despite the accumulative scientific and clinical efforts to target hypoxia, there is still a need to find specific treatments for tumour hypoxia. In this review, we discuss a variety of approaches to alter the low oxygen tumour microenvironment or hypoxia pathways including carbogen breathing, hyperthermia, hypoxia-activated prodrugs, tumour metabolism and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitors. The recent advances in technology and biological understanding reveal the importance of revisiting old therapeutic regimens and repurposing their uses clinically.",

      "abstract": "The pharmacological treatment of cancer has evolved from cytotoxic to molecular targeted therapy. The median survival gains of 124 drugs approved by the FDA from 2003 to 2021 is 2.8 months. Targeted therapy is based on the somatic mutation theory, which has some paradoxes and limitations. While efforts of targeted therapy must continue, we must study newer approaches that could advance therapy and affordability for patients. This work briefly overviews how cancer therapy has evolved from cytotoxic chemotherapy to current molecular-targeted therapy. The limitations of the one-target, one-drug approach considering cancer as a robust system and the basis for multitargeting approach with polypharmacotherapy using repurposing drugs. Multitargeted polypharmacotherapy for cancer with repurposed drugs should be systematically investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Remarkably, most of these proposed drugs already have a long history in the clinical setting, and their safety is known....",

      "abstract": "Two interesting therapeutic proposals for cancer treatment emerged at the beginning of the 21st century. The first one was metronomic chemotherapy, which refers to the chronic administration of chemotherapeutic agents, in low doses, without extended drug-free periods. Then, the idea of drug repositioning in oncology, the use of well-known drugs that were created for other uses to be utilized in oncology, gained strength. Shortly after, the two strategies were merged in one, named metronomics. Both approaches share several features which make metronomics an appealing choice for cancer treatment: use of known and approved drugs, thus diminishing the time necessary to enter to the clinic, therapeutic effect, low toxicity, oral administration, better life quality, low costs because of the use of, generally, out of patent drugs, possibility of use, even in countries with very low economic resources. Many chemotherapy and repurposed drugs were tested with metronomics approaches for the treat...",

Current treatments, including chemotherapy, are hindered by high recurrence rates, drug resistance, and severe side effects, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to address these challenges. Drug repurposing, which involves the application of existing FDA-approved (Food and administration) drugs for new oncological uses, offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional drug development. This review synthesizes recent findings on repurposed drugs, including antidiabetic, antiparasitic, antidepressant, antipsychotic, cardiovascular disease, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and their potential to target TNBC through mechanisms such as immune modulation, interference with signaling pathways, and inhibi...",

We revealed that AF inhibited the induction of proinflammatory proteins and their mRNAs by the inflammatory stimulants, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and their upstream regulator, NF-κB. AF also activated the proteins peroxyredoxin-1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, and NF-E2-related factor 2, and inhibited thioredoxin reductase, all of which are involved in oxidative or electrophilic stress under physiological conditions. Although the cell membrane was previously considered to be permeable to AF because of its hydrophobicity, the mechanisms responsible for transporting AF into and out of cells as well as its effects on the uptake and excretion of other drugs have not yet been elucidated. Antibodies for cytokines have recently been employed in the treatment of RA, which has had an impact on the use of AF...",

However, no single universal cancer cure has yet been found, although combinations from the above areas have steadily improved survival outcomes. Hence, chemotherapy remains a key component in the oncologist's arsenal for cancer therapy, despite frequent development of drug resistance and more aggressive cancers with onset of advanced stage metastases. The focus here is to explore the repurposing of old drugs that cause pro-oxidative overload to overcome onset of resistance to chemotherapy and enhance chemotherapeutic responses, particularly against metastatic cancer.

Despite the improvements in diagnosis and therapy, the prognosis and outcome of lung cancer patients is still poor. This could be associated with the lack of effective first-line oncology drugs, formation of resistant tumors and non-optimal administration route. Therefore, the repurposing of existing drugs currently used for different indications and the introduction of a different method of drug administration could be investigated as an alternative to improve lung cancer therapy.

This chapter highlights opportunities to apply repurposing of drugs along with a mechanistic understanding of radiation effects on cancer and normal tissue to discover new therapy-modifying drugs and help rapidly translate them to the clinic. We survey candidate radiosensitizers that alter DNA repair, decrease hypoxia, block tumor survival signaling, modify tumor metabolism, block growth factor signaling, slow tumor invasiveness, impair angiogenesis, or stimulate antitumor immunity.

      "abstract": "Drug repurposing is a strategy used to develop new treatments based on approved or investigational drugs outside the scope of their original clinical indication. Since this approach benefits from the original toxicity data of the repurposed drugs, the drug-repurposing strategy is timesaving, and inexpensive. It has a higher success rate compared to traditional drug discovery. Several repurposing candidates have been identified in silico screening and in vitro methodologies. One of the best examples is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Tumor-promoting inflammation is one of the hallmarks of cancer, revealing a connection between inflammatory processes and tumor progression and development. This explains why using NSAIDs in the context of neoplasia has become a topic of interest. Indeed, identifying NSAIDs with antitumor activity has become a promising strategy for finding novel cancer treatment opportunities. Indeed, several commercial anti-inflammatory drugs, including as...",

      "abstract": "The \"War on Cancer\" began with the National Cancer Act of 1971 and despite more than 50 years of effort and numerous successes, there still remains much more work to be done. The major challenge remains the complexity and intrinsic polygenicity of neoplastic diseases. Furthermore, the safety of the antitumor therapies still remains a concern given their often off-target effects. Although the amount of money invested in research and development required to introduce a novel FDA-approved drug has continuously increased, the likelihood for a new cancer drug's approval remains limited. One interesting alternative approach, however, is the idea of repurposing of old drugs, which is both faster and less costly than developing new drugs. Repurposed drugs have the potential to address the shortage of new drugs with the added benefit that the safety concerns are already established. That being said, their interactions with other new drugs in combination therapies, however, should be tested. In ...",

Recent works have demonstrated anticancer properties of the FDA-approved drug ribavirin, a synthetic guanosine analogue and antiviral molecule used over the past four decades for the treatment of hepatitis C. The efficacy of ribavirin in cancer has been explored through several preclinical models and ongoing clinical trials in multiple cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and metastatic breast cancer. In this review, we summarize the role of ribavirin as an antiviral medication and focus our attention on its recent use as an antitumoral agent.

Age, family history, & genetic factors are major factors that drive prostate cancer. Although, for treating metastatic disease, the major therapies available are radiation,bisphosphonate, and palliative chemotherapy. But the major drawback is therapy is disease-driven and later becomes metastatic and requires treatment. The ability to revolutionize cancer treatment by major targeting vehicles via the exploration of nanoemulsion suggests a potential for cancer treatment. The unique property of a biphasic liquid dosage form called nanoemulsion to reach leaky tumor vasculature is due to its nano-meter oil-droplet size of 20-200 nm. Recent reporting on nanoemulsions disclose their embracing and lay alternative for re-purposing herbal and synthetic drugs and their combination especially for targeting prostate cancer formulating an o...",

The implementation of combinatorial approaches involving MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors in the context of KRAS-mutated lung cancers focuses fundamentally on targeting KRAS proximal activators or effectors. However, the antitumor effect is highly determined by compensatory mechanisms arising in defined cell types or tumor subgroups. A potential strategy to find drug combinations targeting a larger fraction of KRAS-mutated lung cancers may capitalize on the common, distal gene expression output elicited by oncogenic KRAS. By integrating a signature-driven drug repurposing approach with a pairwise pharmacological screen, here we show synergistic drug combinations consisting of multi-tyrosine kinase PKC inhibitors together with MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors. Such combinations elicit a cytotoxic response in both in vitro and in vivo models, which in part involves inhi...",

We previously established a platform for identifying Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved repurposed drugs for avian influenza A virus infections that could be used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. In this study, we analyzed blood samples from two cohorts of 63 COVID-19 patients, including 19 patients with severe disease. Among the 39 FDA-approved drugs we identified for COVID-19 therapy in both cohorts, 23 drugs were confirmed by literature mining data, including 14 drugs already under COVID-19 clinical trials and 9 drugs reported for COVID-19 treatments, suggesting the remaining 16 FDA-approved drugs may be candidates for COVID-19 therapy. Additionally, we previously reported that herbal small RNAs (sRNAs) could be effective components in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating COVID-19. Based on the abundance of sRNAs, we screened the 245 TCMs in the Bencao (he...",

Additionally, the repurposing of veterinary antiparasitic drugs for the treatment of cancer is gaining traction, as supported by existing literature. A prominent example is the proposal to implement the use of veterinary antiparasitics such as benzimidazole carbamates and halogenated salicylanilides as novel anticancer drugs. These agents have revealed pronounced anti-tumor activities and gained special attention for \"double repositioning\", as they are repurposed for different species and diseases simultaneously, acting via different mechanisms depending on their target. As anticancer agents, these compounds employ several mechanisms, including the inhibition of oncogenic signal transduction pathways of mitochondrial respiration and the inhibition of cellular stress res...",

However, not all tumors respond to checkpoint therapy, and there is clearly a need for additional approaches for enhancing tumor immunity. We summarize the critical elements necessary for mounting an efficacious T-cell response to a tumor. We cite drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for no-cancer indications that could be repurposed and used as part of an antitumor immune cocktail. We also list cancer drugs not initially intended to impact tumor immunity (soft repurposing) but that have been found to modulate the immune system. We highlight those drugs that might be used in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to increase response rates and survival of cancer patients. Our...",

In our body, fat is transported by lipoproteins, intriguing supramolecular nanostructures that have important roles in cell function, lipid metabolism, and disease. Lipoproteins' main constituents are phospholipids and apolipoproteins, forming a corona that encloses a hydrophobic core of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. Within the lipoprotein family, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), primarily composed of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA-I) and phospholipids, measuring a mere 10 nm, is the smallest and densest particle.

Repurposing previously Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications and using novel drug discovery strategies may be an optimal approach. Homoharringtonine (HHT) has been used for hematologic malignancies for over 40 years in China and was approved by the FDA approximately 10 years ago. Many studies have demonstrated that HHT effectively inhibits the development of several types of solid tumors, although the underlying mechanisms of action are unclear.

Cancer, a complex and heterogeneous disease, often necessitates a combination of different treatment modalities to achieve optimal outcomes. The intrinsic polygenicity of cancer, intricate biological signalling networks, and feedback loops make the inhibition of a single target frequently insufficient for achieving the desired therapeutic impact. As a result, addressing these complex or \"smart\" malignancies demands equally sophisticated treatment strategies. Combinatory treatments that target the multifaceted oncogenic signalling network hold immense promise.

Several common drugs, e.g., metformin, statin, and aspirin are on clinical trials for repurposing in oncology treatment. Most of repurposed drugs, however, cannot be used as single agents and some do not exert any clinically significant effects. The limitations and possible biases from observational studies and preclinical models to repurpose these drugs are debatable. In this article, the limitations and probability of using metformin, one of the most repurposed drugs for cancer treatment and in oncological practice, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous cell population within the tumor that have recently come into the spotlight. By extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and robust cross-talk with cancer cells via different secretions such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, CAFs contribute to cancer progression and poorer prognoses in patients. Novel candidates have been developed to inhibit CAFs; however, due to safety and efficacy issues, none have successfully passed clinical trials. Despite these shortcomings, one concept embraced by many researchers is to repurpose non-oncology drugs with potential anti-cancer properties for cancer treatment. One such example is pirfenidone (PFD), an oral anti-fibrotic medication, primarily administered for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Emerging evidence suggests that PFD has promising anti-cancer effects, mainly manifesting through targeting CAFs. With inhibitory effects on CAFs, PFD restricts cancer proliferation, metastasis, im...",

It was anticipated that by being faster, safer, and cheaper, the development would result in lower-cost drugs. As defined in this work, a repurposed cancer drug is one approved by a health regulatory authority against a non-cancer indication that then gains new approval for cancer. With this definition, only three drugs are repurposed for cancer: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (superficial bladder cancer, thalidomide [multiple myeloma], and propranolol [infantile hemangioma]). Each of these has a different history regarding price and affordability, and it is not yet possible to generalize the impact of drug repurposing on the final price to the patient. However, the development, including the price, does not differ significantly from an NME. For the end consumer, the product's price is unrelated to whether it followed the classical de...",

Apart from its prescribed use for severe acne, evidence suggests that isotretinoin is commonly used off-label to treat mild-to-moderate acne, inflammatory skin conditions, genodermatoses, skin cancer, and other skin disorders. This is due to its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antineoplastic properties. Some \"off-label\" use is successful, while others are ineffective. Therefore, this information is essential to clinicians for deciding on the appropriate use of isotretinoin.

Several physicians are now prescribing rapamycin off-label as a preventative therapy to maintain healthspan. Thus far, however, there is limited data available on side effects or efficacy associated with use of rapamycin in this context. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, we collected data from 333 adults with a history of off-label use of rapamycin by survey. Similar data were also collected from 172 adults who had never used rapamycin. Here, we describe the general characteristics of a patient cohort using off-label rapamycin and present initial evidence that rapamycin can be used safely in adults of normal health status.",

Within a specific dosage window, LDN can act as an immunomodulator in multiple autoimmune diseases and malignant tumors as well as alleviate the symptoms of some mental disorders. The results of increasing studies indicate that LDN exerts its immunoregulatory activity by binding to opioid receptors in or on immune cells and tumor cells. These new discoveries indicate that LDN may become a promising immunomodulatory agent in the therapy for cancer and many immune-related diseases.

      "abstract": "Acne impairs quality of life, often leads to permanent scars, and causes psychological distress. This review aims to update dermatologists on the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and off-label use of combined oral contraceptives (COC), clascoterone, spironolactone, and emerging hormonal therapies for acne treatment. We reviewed current literature on hormonal acne treatments and discussed common patient concerns, barriers to care, and individualized care needs. Different brands and dosings of COC have generally similar efficacy in treating acne. Dermatologists should discuss contraceptive options and provide individualized shared decision-making with patients based on patient preferences, contraceptive needs, comorbidity profile, access, and cost. Spironolactone is an effective acne treatment with clinical trial data to support its use as a first-line acne treatment for women with acne. Potassium monitoring is of low value for patients on spironolactone unless patients have sp...",

Pathologic findings show pulmonary capillaritis, bland hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, but in the majority of cases, pathogenesis remains unclear. Despite the severity and high mortality, the current treatment options for DAH remain empirical. Systemic treatment to control inflammatory activity including high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab and supportive care have been applied, but largely unsuccessful in critical cases. Activated recombinant factor VII (FVIIa) can achieve rapid local hemostasis and has been administered either systemically or intrapulmonary for the treatment of DAH. However, there is no randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety, and the use of FVIIa for DAH remains open to debate. This review discusses the pathogenesis, diverse etio...",

TKIs have revolutionized long-term outcomes of CML patients and their life expectancy. Nonetheless, a minority of patients will develop TKI resistance due to a complex and multifactorial process that ultimately leads to the emergence of an unresponsive cancer clone. Overcoming TKI resistance is considered one of the major challenges in CML management. In this review, the main findings extrapolated from published research, guidelines, and clinical trials regarding TKI resistance (published before October 2024) are discussed.

A literature review of all articles assessing testosterone and the use of TTh and the association with CV events, prostate cancer, BPH and lifestyle modification was conducted. Majority of patients treated with TTh today are treated off-label. Low serum testosterone levels have been associated with increased CV events.

We completed a retrospective single-institution cohort study evaluating prevalence, characteristics, and clinical outcomes of off-label prescribing of 108 FDA-approved targeted anticancer drugs in patients < 30 years old treated for cancer from 2007 to 2017. Dosing strategies were adjusted for body size and compared to FDA-approved adult dosing regimen. A composite toxicity endpoint was defined as a patient having unplanned clinic visits, emergency department visits, or unplanned hospital admissions that were at least possibly related to the off-label treatment. The overall prevalence of off-label use of targeted therapies was 9.2% (n = 374 patients). The prevalence increased significantly over the study period (P < .0001). Patients treated off-label were more likely to have neuro-oncology diagnoses compared to patients...",

However, patterns of off-label use of ICI in pediatrics remain unclear. This is a single-institution, retrospective cohort study evaluating off-label ICI use in pediatric and young adult patients with cancer treated at our institution from 2014 to 2022. Response was based on clinician assessment derived from clinical records. Immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) were classified according to CTCAE v5.0. We identified 50 unique patients treated with off-label ICI (28 with solid tumors, 20 with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, 2 with hematologic malignancies). At time of ICI initiation, only five patients (10%) had localized disease, and all but one patient was treated in the relapsed/refractory setting. All patients were treated with the FDA-approved weight-based dosing recommendations. Overall, there was disease control in 21 patients...",

Up to one third of all prescriptions are for non-indicated use, which in addition to drug repurposing includes different dosing or duration than those recommended. In this review, we elaborate on what antidepressants can treat besides depression. The five classes of drugs for depression are introduced, and their mechanisms of action and serious side effects are described. The most common off-label uses of antidepressants are discussed, with a special focus on treating eating disorders, sleep problems, smoking cessation and managing chronic pain. Depression is often a comorbidity when antidepressants are chosen as therapy, but good therapeutic effects have been observed for other conditions also when depression is not involved. Finally, a new type of antidepressant developed from the hallucinogenic \"party drug\" ketamine is briefly introduced. This recent developmen...",

Among these, ICI-related colitis is one of the most common, with a disabling impact on the patient. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, cramping, and hematochezia are the most common ICI enterocolitis presenting symptoms. The most frequently used grading system for assessment of the severity of ICI enterocolitis is called the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading. With regard to the histological picture, there is no specific feature; however, microscopic damage can be classified into five types: (1) acute active colitis, (2) chronic active colitis, (3) microscopic colitis-like, (4) graft-versus-host disease-like, and (5) other types.

A deep understanding of genomic alterations in different tumor types would help identify potentially actionable genomic changes which occur across a wide variety of tumor types. A basket trial is a new type of clinical trial for which eligibility is based on the presence of a specific genomic alteration, irrespective of histology. Basket trials are phase II screening trials for the off-label use of a targeted drug in patients with the same genomic alterations for which it was approved. Intractable cancer refers to a type or condition of cancer which is unresponsive or resistant to treatment; intractable cancers may be classified into five subtypes as follows: hard-to-treat condition of common advanced cancer after multiple-line therapy, rare cancer in which no standard of care has been recommended, advanced cancer in which s...",

To determine whether evidence from randomized clinical trials is associated with reimbursement decisions for requested off-label use of anticancer drugs in the Swiss health system. This cross-sectional study used reimbursement requests from routinely collected health records of 5809 patients with drug treatment for cancer between January 2015 and July 2018 in 3 major cancer centers, covering cancer care of approximately 5% of the Swiss population, to identify off-label drug use. For each off-label use indication with 3 or more requests, randomized clinical trial evidence on treatment benefits was systematically identified for overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). Data were analyzed from August 2018 to December 2020. Available randomized clinical trial evidence on benefits for OS or PFS for requested off-labe...",

For localized disease, local therapy is recommended such as triple therapy for H. pylori in gastric extranodal MZL, splenectomy for splenic MZL, and radiotherapy for nodal MZL. For disseminated disease with low tumor burden, a watch and wait or single-agent rituximab can be used. However, for symptomatic disease, a similar approach to follicular lymphoma (FL) can be used with chemoimmunotherapy approaches such as bendamustine and rituximab. High FDG uptake is not common in MZL and is not diagnostic by itself of transformation to high-grade lymphoma but informs the choice of the site to be biopsied.

Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs.

      "abstract": "The off-label use of medicines is widespread in several diseases. This type of prescribing practice is particularly more acute in oncology. However, the suitability of anticancer medications for off-label use remains an issue of controversy, due to uncertainty around the clinical benefits and potential toxicities, limited evidence to support clinical decision-making, increased out-of-pocket costs for patients and ethical concerns around the lack of informed consent. Currently, data pertaining to the global prevalence of off-label use in cancer therapy are lacking. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of off-label drug use prevalence in oncology. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines from 1975 to 2016. Studies assessing the prevalence of off-label use of anticancer drugs were included. Of the 199 eligible papers retrieved, 23 studies were included in this systematic lit...",

Those cells are not only adapted to this sanctuary environment, blunting of immunity but also, grow, migrate to the distal area (metastasis) and communicate with each other in a unique population structure and organization too (clonal expansion). The adaptation requirements push those types of adaptable cells (cancer cells) to be primitive cells. The prevailing pharmacological approach in treating cancer is developing a chemotherapeutic agent that acts on rapidly proliferating cells that are stuck with normally growing epithelium and bone marrow too. The latter approach has been drafted to work on cellular target under the term of \"targeted therapy\" believing that each target represents Achilles Heels of cancer. In this article, we try to introduce a new concept of cancer pharmacology, by offering new off-label use of Doxycycline, which is characterized by selective toxi...",

Although studies have provided evidence that senolytics or senomorphics are effective at decreasing the number of senescent cells in humans, the short-term and long-term side-effects of these therapies are largely unknown.

This method of therapy has the term \"off-label use\" which means the use \"out of instruction\". Today, off-label drugs are also prescribed for cancer treatment. For example, a drug developed to treat one type of tumor can sometimes be used to treat other types of cancer. The treatment of certain types of pain with tricyclic antidepressants is also an example of the off-label drugs used in oncology. An example of an off-label prescription is anxiolytic medicine lorazepam, which can be used off-label as an antiemetic in cancer patients. Low doses of naltrexone are applied to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. A retrospective analysis of modern oncotherapy indicates that oncologists often use off-label drugs in combination therapy, especially in the treatment of patients with concomitant diseases, ...",

Only very few, recurrent mutations or copy-number variations in cancer-causing genes have been identified. The two most common alterations in breast cancer are TP53 (affecting the majority of triple-negative breast cancers) and PIK3CA (affecting almost half of estrogen receptor-positive cancers) mutations, followed by a long tail of individually rare mutations affecting <1%-20% of cases. Each cancer harbors from a few dozen to a few hundred potentially high-functional impact somatic variants, along with a much larger number of potentially high-functional impact germline variants. It is likely that it is the combined effect of all genomic variations that drives the clinical behavior of a given cancer. Furthermore, entirely new classes of oncogenic events are being discovered in the noncoding areas of the genome and in noncodi...",

IL-1α is constitutively present in endothelial and epithelial cells, whereas IL-1β is inducible in myeloid cells and released following cleavage by caspase-1.

However in recent years, more attention has been paid to the possibility of using metformin as an anti-aging drug. It was shown to significantly increase the lifespan in some model organisms and delay the onset of age-associated declines. The current review summarizes advances in clinical research on the potential role of metformin in the field of lifespan and healthspan extension. Growing amounts of evidence from clinical trials suggest that metformin can effectively reduce the risk of many age-related diseases and conditions, including cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, chronic inflammation and frailty. Metformin also holds promise as a drug that could be repurposed for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy for certain types of cancer. Moreover, metformin induces autophagy by activation of AMPK and can thus be potentially used to promote heathspan by hormesis-like mechanisms. Alt...",

The advances seen in MM therapy have relied on both a structured approach to obtaining new labels and cautious off-label drug use. Although there are country and regional differences in drug approval processes, many of the basic principles behind off-label drug use in MM can be summarized into four main categories: 1) use of a therapy prior to the current approval regulations; 2) widespread use of a therapy following the release of promising clinical trial results but prior to drug approval; 3) use of a cheap therapy supported by clinical safety and efficacy data but without commercial backing; and 4) niche therapies for small well-defined patient populations where large clinical trials with sufficient power may be difficult to pe...",

Cancer patients often seek alternative therapies in addition to, or instead of, conventional treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. The progress in medical advancements and early detection provides more treatment options; however, the development of cancer drugs requires a significant amount of time, demands substantial investments, and results in an overall low percent of regulatory approval. The complex relationship between patent protection and pharmaceutical innovation complicates cancer drug development and contributes to high mortality rates. Adjusting patent criteria for alternative cancer therapeutics could stimulate innovation, enhance treatment options, and ultimately improve outcomes for cancer patients.

We used Truven MarketScan data from 1999 to 2007 on utilization of 35 infused chemotherapy drugs in private health plans in the United States, covering the period when eight states implemented off-label coverage laws. We studied trends in off-label use of drugs, distinguishing between appropriate and inappropriate off-label use according to drug compendia, and estimated difference-in-difference regressions of the effect of state laws on off-label use. We estimate 41% of utilization was off-label, including 17% of use conservatively defined as inappropriate. Trends show gradual declines in off-label use over time. We also find no discernable effect of state laws mandating coverage ...",

Associations between demographic characteristics and 1 L ICI receipt in the off-label and postapproval periods were examined using multivariable logistic regression. We identified 23,469 patients, of which 368 (2.4%) off-label and 1,663 (21%) postapproval received 1 L ICI.

Delirium is associated with significant symptom burden which causes distress and impacts quality of life. As recommended by international guidelines, a high degree of suspicion is needed to ensure delirium is detected early. Attention to collateral history can provide clues to changes in cognition and attention. Non-pharmacological approaches that can be considered essential elements of care are effective in reducing the risk of delirium. Delirium screening using a validated measure is recommended as even expert clinicians can underdiagnose or miss delirium. The diagnostic assessment requires consideration of the cancer diagnosis and comorbidities, in the context of potential reversibility, goals of care, and patient preferences. The gold standard approach based on expert consensus is to institute management for delirium precipitants supported by non-pharmacological essentia...",

Not surprisingly, calcium (Ca2+) channel blockers (CCBs), classically used as antihypertensive medicines, have been demonstrating off-label effects such as alleviating asthma symptoms, in addition to antidiabetic, antiobesity, anticancer and antineurodegenerative effects. Our studies about Ca2+/cAMP signalling may shed some new light on this field.

However, soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) present a challenge in developing preclinical drug-testing models due to their non-epithelial and complex nature. Here, we report a model termed patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs) derived from STS patients. PTCs result from the self-assembly and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), epithelial cells, and immune cells, faithfully recapitulating the morphology and function of the original tumors. Through standardized culture and drug-response assessment protocols, PTCs facilitate personalized drug testing, evaluating hundreds of therapies within two weeks. Notably, PTCs exhibit 100% accuracy in distinguishing between complete or partial response and disease progression. We demonstrate the utility of PTCs in guiding chemotherapy selection for a patient with relapse and metastases following conventional therapy, who exhibited a positive response after non-conventional the...",

Nowadays, the absence of approved specific targeted therapies to eradicate TNBC remains one of the main challenges in clinical practice. Drug discovery is a long and costly process that can be dramatically improved by drug repurposing, which identifies new uses for existing drugs, both approved and investigational. Drug repositioning benefits from improvements in computational methods related to chemoinformatics, genomics, and systems biology. To the best of our knowledge, we propose a novel and inclusive classification of those approaches whereby drug repurposing can be achieved in silico: structure-based, transcriptional signatures-based, biological networks-based, and data-mining-based drug repositioning. This review specially emphasizes the most relevant research, both at preclinical and clinical settings, aimed at repurposing pre-exist...",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, characterized by extensive intratumoral heterogeneity, high metastasis, and chemoresistance, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Despite progress, the mechanistic basis of these aggressive behaviors remains poorly understood. Using single-cell and spatial transcriptome analysis, here we discovered basal epithelial subpopulations located within the stroma that exhibit chemoresistance characteristics. The subpopulations are defined by distinct signature genes that show a frequent gain in copy number and exhibit an activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program. A subset of these genes can accurately predict chemotherapy response and are associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, among these genes, elevated ITGB1 participates in enhancing intercellular signaling while ACTN1 confers a survival advantage to foster chemoresistance. Furthermore, by subjecting the transcriptional signatures to drug re...",

Especially in women, breast cancer is still a cancer with a high incidence and mortality. Even though mortality rates for this type of cancer have declined in recent years, it remains challenging at the treatment level, especially the metastatic type. Due to all the impact on health, cancer therapy is the subject of costly and intense research. To enrich this therapy, as well as decrease its underlying high associated costs, drug repurposing and drug combinations are strategies that have been increasingly studied and addressed.

Cellular processes such as metabolic reprogramming and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contribute to the complexity of breast cancer by driving uncontrolled cell division, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. Strategically targeting these intricate pathways can effectively impede breast cancer progression, thereby revealing significant potential for therapeutic interventions. Among various emerging therapeutic approaches, drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for enhancing clinical outcomes. In recent years, high-throughput screening, QSAR, and network pharmacology have been widely employed to identify promising repurposed drugs. As an outcome, several drugs, such as Metformin, Itraconazole, Pimozide, and Disulfiram, were repurposed to regulate metabolic and EMT pathways. Moreover, strategies such as combination therapy, targeted delivery, and p...",

Breast cancer subtypes have been developed in order to capture some of this heterogeneity. Each of these breast cancer subtypes, in turns retains varied characteristic features impacting diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutics. Basal breast tumors, in particular have been challenging in these regards. Basal breast cancer is often more aggressive, of rapid evolution and no tailor-made targeted therapies are available yet to treat it. Arguably, epigenetic variability is behind some of these intricacies. It is possible to further classify basal breast tumor in groups based on their non-coding transcriptome and methylome profiles. It is expected that these groups will have differences in survival as well as in sensitivity to certain classes of drugs. With this in mind, we implemented a computational learning approach to infer different subpopulations of basal breast cancer (from TCGA multi...",

Despite drug repurposing significantly decrease the investigational period and cost, it has got many objections and issues. Scaffold repurposing is an approach that procures a novel significance on the decrepit motto of \"to commencement with a pristine drug\" . Hence, we move into a probable and nearer approach, the exploitation of scaffolds, which was originally developed for other purposes, including anti-tumor activity.

Halo's activity, partially mediated by sigma (σ) receptors, may enhance chemotherapy efficacy. This investigation delves into the role of heme oxygenase (HO), which was demonstrated to exhibit dual effects in ferroptosis as it's crucial for the modulation of iron intracellular levels and redox balance.

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide, characterized by a high mortality rate and propensity for metastasis. Although surgery is the standard treatment for breast cancer, there is still no effective method to inhibit tumor metastasis and improve the prognosis of patients with breast cancer after surgery. Propofol, one of the most widely used intravenous anesthetics in surgery, has exhibited a positive association with improved survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer post‑surgery. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. The present study revealed that triple negative breast cancer cells, MDA‑MB‑231 and 4T1, exposed to propofol exhibited a significant decrease in cell viability. Notably, propofol exhibited minimal cytotoxic effects on HUVECs under the same conditions. Furthermore, propofol significantly inhibited the migration and invasion ability of MDA‑MB‑231 and 4T1 cells. Propofol promoted apoptosis in 4T1 cells throug...",

Drug repurposing offers advantages in comparison with traditional drug development procedures, reducing time and risk. This systematic review identified the most recent randomized controlled clinical trials that focus on drug repurposing in oncology.

Metformin has been studied for potential use in various types of cancer, including prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Other studies assessed the possible use of the antiparasitic agent mebendazole in colorectal cancer and of propranolol in multiple myeloma or, when combined with etodolac, in breast cancer.

Targeting CDK4/6 has shown considerable promise in treating various cancers, including breast cancer. Despite significant therapeutic efficacy, resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), such as palbociclib, remains a substantial hurdle in clinical practice. Using a coculture system, cytokine array, and quantitative high-throughput combinatorial screening, we discovered a mechanism by which the Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) 1-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB axis regulates palbociclib resistance in breast cancer cells. Specifically, RUNX1 functioned as a transcription factor to drive expression of PDGFB, leading to resistance to palbociclib by enhancing the Akt pathway and suppressing senescence. Furthermore, in resistant cells, RUNX1 was O-GlcNAcylated at serine 252 by O-GlcNAc transferase, resulting in the stabilization of RUNX1 by preventing ubiquitin...",

LMD is a spread of cancer into leptomeningeal space that speeds up the disease progression and severely aggravates the prognosis. LMD has limited treatment options. We sought to test whether the common anti-helminthic drug mebendazole (MBZ) may be effective against murine TNBC LMD. A small-molecule screen involving TNBC cell lines identified benzimidazoles as potential therapeutic agents for further study. In vitro migration assays were used to evaluate cell migration capacity and the effect of MBZ. For in vivo testing, CNS metastasis was introduced into BALB/c athymic nude mice through internal carotid artery injections of brain-tropic MDA-MB-231-BR or MCF7-BR cells. Tumor growth and spread was monitored by bioluminescence imaging and immunohistochemistry. MBZ was given orally at 50 and 100 mg/k...",

Neurotransmitters play a key role in breast cancer biology through their effects on the cell cycle, epithelial mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, inflammation, the tumor microenvironment and other pathways. Neurotransmitters and their receptors are vital to the initiation, progression and drug resistance of cancer and progress in our biological understanding may point the way to lower-cost and lower-risk antitumor therapeutic strategies. This review discusses multiple neurotransmitters in the context of breast cancer. It also discusses risk factors, repurposing of pharmaceuticals impacting neurotransmitter pathways, and the opportunity for better integrated models that encompass exercise, the intestinal microbiome, and other non-pharmacologic considerations.

It is a heterogeneous disease that accounts for 30 percent of all women diagnosed with cancer. To bring an anti-cancer drug from the bench to the bedside is an expensive and time-consuming process. The drug repurposing approach targets new enemies (new diseases) with old weapons (known drugs). The present study identified an FDA-approved drug targeting the γ-secretase complex involved in the Notch signaling pathway in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). A literature survey and in-silico study identified Venetoclax as a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) from 1615 FDA-approved drug compounds. In-silico docking potential of Venetoclax was better than the standard γ-secretase inhibitor RO4929097. Also, the molecular dynamics simulations of 200 ns confirmed the stability of the Venetoclax-γ-secretase complex. These findings suggest that the use of Venetoclax represents a potential γ-secretase inhibitor in brea...",

Here, we delineate the intricate relationship between breast cancer and COVID-19. Breast cancer and COVID-19 share the involvement of common comorbidities, hormonal signalling pathways, gender differences, rennin- angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). We also shed light on the possible effects of therapeutic modalities of COVID-19 on breast cancer outcomes. Briefly, we conclude that breast cancer patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 in comparison with their normal counterparts. Women are more resistant to the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. Increased expressions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are correlated with occurrence and severity of COVID-19, but higher expression of ACE2 and lower expression of TMPRSS2 are prognostic mar...",

TNBC lacks the expression of major hormonal receptors like estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 and is further subdivided into androgen receptor (AR) positive and AR negative. In contrast, AR negative is also known as quadruple-negative breast cancer (QNBC). Compared to AR-positive TNBC, QNBC has a great scarcity of prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. QNBC shows excessive cellular growth and proliferation of tumor cells due to increased expression of growth factors like EGF and various surface proteins.

The inhibitory activities of CPZ and its combination with several standard treatment drugs were evaluated in preclinical TNBC models. The mechanism of CPZ on TNBC was elucidated using TMT-labeled quantitative proteomics analysis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CPZ robustly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, particularly in lung and brain models. Importantly, CPZ enhanced the efficacy of standard therapeutic agents such as vinorelbine (NVB) and anti-PD-1 antibody.

Despite the recent efforts to understand the underlying cause of the resistance due to mutation, there are no feasible tactics to overcome this bottleneck.

Of note, we have proposed a multi-modal computational drug-repositioning stratagem to predict drugs possessing anti-proliferative effect.

Recently, this role has extended to other areas including inflammation, obesity, diabetes, as well as breast cancer. RAS components are expressed in normal and cancerous breast tissues, and downregulation of RAS inhibits metastasis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and desmoplasia in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, RAS inhibitors (Angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs, or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ACE-I) may be beneficial as preventive adjuvant therapies to thwart breast cancer development and improve outcomes, respectively. Given the beneficial effects of RAS inhibitors in metabolic diseases, which often co-exist in breast cancer patients, combining RAS inhibitors with other breast cancer therapies may enhance the effectiveness of current treatments. This review scrutinizes above associations, to advance our understanding of the role of RAS in breast cancer an...",

Repositioning of clinically approved drugs has emerged as a novel approach for breast cancer therapy. However, serendipitous or experiential repurposing cannot be used as a routine method. In this study, we proposed a graph neural network model GraphRepur based on GraphSAGE for drug repurposing against breast cancer. GraphRepur integrated two major classes of computational methods, drug network-based and drug signature-based.

Among BCs, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive, and for its histochemical and molecular characteristics is also the one whose therapeutic opportunities are most limited. The REpurposing Drugs in Oncology (ReDO) project investigates the potential use of off patent non-cancer drugs as sources of new cancer therapies. Repurposing of old non-cancer drugs, clinically approved, off patent and with known targets into oncological indications, offers potentially cheaper effective and safe drugs. In line with this project, this article describes a comprehensive overview of preclinical or clinical evidence of drugs included in the ReDO database and/or PubMed for repurposing as anticancer drugs into TNBC therapeutic treatments.",

Since the current therapies are insufficient to address chemoresistance, more potent strategies are urgently required to enhance current treatment plans. Chemoresistance in cancer can arise from a variety of molecular mechanisms, like drug efflux, decreased drug uptake, enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, the ability of cancer cells to avoid apoptosis, tumour heterogeneity and significant alterations in the tumour microenvironment, where interactions between cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cells and the extracellular matrix contribute to a supportive environment that allows tumours to survive treatment and escape therapy. The available therapeutic strategies include combination therapies, immunotherapies, epigenetic modulators and drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles are a few promising strategies towards overcoming chemoresistance.

Cuproptosis, a copper-dependent programmed cell death process, has been associated with patient prognosis. Inducing cuproptosis is a promising approach for therapy. However, there is currently no anti-breast cancer drug that induces cuproptosis. In this study, we repositioned the clinical drug fluphenazine as a potential agent for breast cancer treatment by inducing cuproptosis. Firstly, we utilized the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Connectivity Map (CMap) database to identify 22 potential compounds with anti-breast cancer activity through inducing cuproptosis. Subsequently, our findings demonstrated that fluphenazine effectively suppressed the viability of MCF-7 cells. Fluphenazine also significantly inhibited the viability of triple negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231. Furthermore, our study r...",

Multiple context-dependent mechanisms of action are emerging, involving modulation of quiescence, senescence, autophagy, cellular metabolism, and enhanced tumor cell immunogenicity. These mechanisms may be driven by interactions with unexpected targets. We review cellular responses to the Food and Drug Administration-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, and summarize available knowledge of other drugs undergoing clinical trials, including data on their off-target landscapes.

Breast cancers have varying degrees of molecular heterogeneity; therefore, they are divided into various molecular clinical sub types. Recent reports suggest that type 2 diabetes (one of the common chronic diseases worldwide) is linked to the higher incidence, accelerated progression, and aggressiveness of different cancers; especially breast cancer. Breast cancer is hormone-dependent in nature and has a cross-talk with metabolism. A number of antidiabetic therapies are known to exert beneficial effects on various types of cancers, including...",

Low-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by an indolent growth pattern and a high prevalence of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) and hormone receptor positivity, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors (eg, trametinib, binimetinib) specifically target the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, whereas endocrine therapies and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors exploit hormone-driven pathways. This review explores the repurposing of the therapeutic potential of both MEK inhibitors and breast cancer therapies, as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, to improve outcomes in low-grade serous ovarian cancer.

After further examination of the discovered patient subgroups, we identified five homogeneous druggable TNBC subgroups. A drug repositioning algorithm was then applied to find the drugs with a high potential for each subgroup. Most of the top drugs for these subgroups were chemotherapy used for various types of cancer, including BC. After analyzing the biological mechanisms targeted by these drugs, ferroptosis was the common cell death mechanism induced by the top drugs in the subgroups with neoplasm subdivision and race as clinical variables.

A high-throughput screen of 133 FDA-approved drugs, integrating image-based analysis and drug-sensitivity assays, identified the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib as potent cytotoxic agents. Proteomic analysis, coupled with translation and cell cycle assays, showed that these inhibitors suppress TNBC organoid growth by downregulating ribosomal protein expression, leading to impaired translation and disrupted cell cycle progression. Furthermore, drug response dynamics confirmed their efficacy in overcoming clinical drug resistance. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that proteasome inhibitors counteract dox...",

Stabilizing these G4 structures offers a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting key oncogenic pathways. In this study, we employed a drug repurposing approach to identify FDA-approved drugs capable of binding and stabilizing G4s in breast cancer-related genes. Using ligand-based virtual screening and biophysical methods, we identified several promising compounds, such as azelastine, belotecan, and irinotecan, as effective G4 binders, with significant antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cell lines.

Experimental studies revealed that metformin has anticancer effects via various pathways, potentially inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Concurrently, multiple nonrandomized observational studies reported remarkable reductions in cancer incidence and outcomes with metformin use. However, these studies were shown, in 2012, to be affected by time-related biases, such as immortal time bias, which tend to greatly exaggerate the benefit of a drug. The observational studies that avoided these biases did not find an association.

Over the last decade, evidence has implicated RANKL/RANK pathway in hormone and HER2-driven breast carcinogenesis and in the acquisition of molecular and phenotypic traits associated with breast cancer (BCa) aggressiveness and poor prognosis. This marked a new era in the research of the therapeutic use of RANKL inhibition in BCa.

Despite advancements in the clinical application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), drug resistance remains a major concern hindering treatment efficacy. Thus, identifying the key genes involved in driving NAC resistance and targeting them with known potential FDA-approved drugs could be applied to advance the precision medicine strategy. With this aim, we performed an integrative bioinformatics study to identify the key genes associated with NAC resistance in breast cancer and then performed the drug repurposing to identify the potential drugs which could use in combination with NAC to overcome drug resistance. In this study, we used publicly available RNA-seq datasets from the samples of breast cancer patients sensitive and resistant to chemotherapy and identified a total of 1446 differentially expressed genes in NAC-resistant breast cancer patients. Next, we performed gene co-expression network ...",

Drug repositioning leverages existing safety and pharmacokinetic data to expedite the identification of new indications with cost-effective benefits compared to de novo drug discovery. In this critical narrative review, we examine recent advances in computational repositioning strategies for breast cancer, focusing on network-based methods, computer-aided drug design, artificial intelligence and machine learning, transcriptomic signature matching, and multi-omics integration. We highlight key case studies that have progressed to preclinical validation or clinical evaluation.

      "abstract": "Breast cancer has been one of the supreme causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. To make the case even more compounded, due to innate or acquired causes, cancer cells often develop resistance against the available chemotherapy or monotargeted treatments. This resistance is concomitant with increased activation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway. This study simultaneously targets three imperative intermediates in this pathway using molecular docking and real-time simulation. Docking was performed via the integrated AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 & 1.2.5 of the PyRx software, while the Discovery Studio (BIOVIA) v24.1.0.23298 was utilized to conduct the simulation. The aim is to investigate the therapeutic prospects of known potential inhibitors of the targeted intermediates and repurposable drugs to comprehend the effectiveness of targeting these trinodes simultaneously.

Secondly, several dysregulated biological processes in both indications were analyzed by functional enrichment methods, and significant overlapping processes were identified. To establish common regulatory mechanisms, information about transcription factors and miRNAs associated with both the disorders was extracted. Finally, disease-specific gene expression signatures were compared through LINCS L1000 analysis to identify potential repurposing drugs for PD.

A computational drug repurposing approach was proposed to predict novel drug-target interactions (DTIs), as well as to predict the type of interaction induced. The methodology is based on mining a heterogeneous graph that integrates drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks, together with verified drug-disease and protein-disease associations. In order to extract appropriate features, the three-layer heterogeneous graph was mapped to low dimensional vectors using node embedding principles. The DTI prediction problem was formulated as a multi-label, multi-class classification task, aiming to determine drug modes of action. DTIs were defined by concatenating pairs of drug and target...",

Clinical manifestations, magnetic resonance imaging, and CSF biopsy are the key components in the diagnosis of NSCLC with LM. CSF cytology is insufficient and should be combined with liquid biology. The application of radiotherapy, intrathecal treatment, targeted therapy and immunotherapy provides more options for LM patients. Each treatment has a particular level of efficacy and can be used alone or in combination for individual patients. New technologies in radiotherapy, drug repositioning in intrathecal treatment, and...",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Lung cancers can be classified as small-cell (SCLC) or non-small cell (NSCLC). About 84% of all lung cancers are NSCLC and about 16% are SCLC. For the past few years, there have been a lot of new advances in the management of NSCLC in terms of screening, diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, most of the NSCLCs are resistant to current treatments and eventually progress to advanced stages. In this perspective, we discuss some of the drugs that can be repurposed to specifically target the inflammatory pathway of NSCLC utilizing its well-defined inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Continuous inflammatory conditions are responsible to induce DNA damage and enhance cell division rate in lung tissues. There are existing anti-inflammatory drugs which were found suitable for repurposing in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) treatment and drug modification for delivery via inhalation.

While radiotherapy (RT) has been a lasting cornerstone of LC management, there are concerns due to tumor radioresistance and unintended damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Ferroptosis is a recently described mechanism of programmed cell death which has potential to serve as a complementary adjunct to facilitate RT-based LC treatment. This review is a comprehensive overview of ferroptosis in the broader context of synergism with RT for LC. Ferroptosis is essentially driven by intracellular iron overload, which drives the formation of reactive oxygen species, ultimately resulting in membrane instability and cell death. LC lines have been shown to exhibit a heterogeneous mix of pro- and anti-ferroptotic changes. RT shows promise as a potential ferroptosis inducer, especially when complemented with pharmacologic agents such as erastin.

Drug repurposing was naturally endowed with co-therapeutic potential of two indications, implying a unique chance in the development of bi-functional agents.

The five-year survival rate of this disease is extremely low (17.8 %), mainly due to difficult early diagnosis and to the limited efficacy of currently available chemotherapeutics. This underlines the necessity to develop innovative therapies for lung cancer. In this context, drug repurposing represents a viable approach, as it reduces the turnaround time of drug development removing costs associated to safety testing of new molecular entities. Ribavirin, an antiviral molecule used to treat hepatitis C virus infections, is particularly promising as repurposed drug for cancer treatment, having shown therapeutic activity against glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Herein, sorafenib-induced TRIB3 is identified as a liver-specific determinant driving secondary resistance to sorafenib by facilitating the accumulation of protumorigenic neutrophils within tumors. Mechanistically, TRIB3, triggered by the sorafenib-elicited ROS-ER stress axis, operates in an NF-κB-dependent manner to upregulate CXCR1/2 ligands, subsequently promoting neutrophil recruitment into tumors. These enriched neutrophils enhance epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes in malignant cells through the oncostatin M-STAT3 pathway, thereby repurposing the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib away from anti-angiogenesis and toward lung metastasis.

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 2022. The majority (80%) of lung cancer cases belong to the non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) subtype. Despite the increased screening efforts, the median five-year survival of metastatic NSCLC remains low at approximately 3%. Common treatment approaches for NSCLC include surgery, multimodal chemotherapy, and concurrent radio and chemotherapy. NSCLC exhibits high rates of resistance to treatment, driven by its heterogeneity and the plasticity of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Drug repurposing offers a faster and cheaper way to develop new antineoplastic purposes for existing drugs, to help overcome therapy resistance. The decrease in time and funds needed stems from the availability of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to be repurposed. This review provides a synopsis of the drug-repurposing approaches and mechanisms of ac...",

      "abstract": "There is now a considerable body of evidence for sildenafil possessing anticancer properties. In this article, we argue the case for testing sildenafil as a lung cancer therapy chemoadjuvant. Currently, lung cancer is a disease with insufficient treatment options, with only 20% of patients responding to systemic chemotherapy, and even incremental potential improvements should be explored. We review the literature concerning the biochemical, physiological and metabolic effects on cancer cells by sildenafil alone, and when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. Most studies have shown that sildenafil is cytotoxic to cancer cells, both as a monotherapy and as a chemoadjuvant. Sildenafil enhances cancer cell apoptosis when used as a chemoadjuvant both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, in rodent experiments sildenafil has decreased tumour size compared to chemotherapy alone. Sildenafil has also been proven as an agent to decrease drug-efflux by cancer cells and increases blood perfusion ...",

In the past, drug repurposing has been largely accidental and serendipitous. The most successful examples so far have not involved a systematic approach. Nowadays, remarkable advances in drugs, diseases and bioinformatic knowledge are offering great opportunities for designing novel drug repurposing approach through comprehensive understanding of drug information. In this study, we introduced a novel drug repurposing approach based on transcriptomic data and chemical structures using deep learning. One strong candidate for repurposing has been identified. Pimozide is an anti-dyskinesia agent that is used for the suppression of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's Disorder.

Now, however, auranofin is rarely used in clinical practice despite its efficacy for treating rheumatoid arthritis because more novel antirheumatic medications are available. Although its use in clinical practice has decreased, studies on auranofin have continued and it shows promise for the treatment of several different diseases, including cancer and bacterial and parasitic infections. Several potential novel applications of auranofin for treating human disease have been proposed. Auranofin inhibits the activity of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), an enzyme of the thioredoxin (Trx) system that is important for maintaining the intracellular redox state. Particularly in cancers, TrxR inhibition leads to an increase in cellular oxidative stress and induces apoptosis. TrxR overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor progression and poor su...",

Virtual screening of the FDA-approved library of 3839 compounds was carried out, from which Bagrosin and Dehydrocholic acid appeared best due to their strong binding affinity, specific interactions, and potential biological characteristics, and thus were selected for further investigations. Both compounds show strong interactions with functionally important residues of the PDK3 with a binding affinity of - 10.6 and - 10.5 kcal/mol for Bagrosin and Dehydrocholic acid, respectively. MD simulation studies for 100 ns suggest the formation of stable complexes, which is evident from RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA parameters. The PCA and...",

Accordingly, drug repurposing arises as a powerful strategy to identify and use drugs already approved for other conditions, offering advantages in terms of cost, development time, and safety. Src and Abl tyrosine kinases have been investigated as potential targets in oncology, being frequently implicated in tumour development and progression by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of five tyrosine kinase inhibitors-saracatinib, imatinib, PP2, nilotinib and, tirbanibulin-that act on Src and/or Abl. Their mechanisms of action, original therapeutic indications, and potential for repurposing in other diseases, such as lung cancer, will be discussed.

NF-κB activation causes inappropriate inflammatory responses in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, modulation of NF-κB signaling is being widely investigated as an approach to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity and cancer. The emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019, the subsequent pandemic and the huge clinical burden of patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia led to a massive scramble to repurpose existing medicines to treat lung inflammation in a wide range of healthcare systems.

This could decrease the regulatory site phosphorylation by stabilizing the PH-in conformation. Hence, in this study, a computational investigation was undertaken to identify allosteric Akt-1 inhibitors from FDA-approved drugs. The molecules were docked at standard precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP), followed by Prime molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on selected hits.

      "abstract": "Autoimmune disorders and some types of blood cancer originate when B lymphocytes malfunction. In particular, when B cells produce antibodies recognizing the body's proteins, it leads to various autoimmune disorders. Additionally, when B cells of various developmental stages transform into cancer cells, it results in blood cancers, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia. Thus, new methods of targeting B cells are required for various patient groups. Here, we used protein kinase inhibitors alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, entrectinib, and lorlatinib previously approved as drugs treating anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung cancer cells. We hypothesized that the same inhibitors will efficiently target leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK)-positive, actively protein-secreting mature B lymphocytes, including plasma cells. We isolated CD19-positive human B cells from the blood of healthy donors and used two alternative methods to stimulate cell maturation toward ...",

To date, platinum-based chemotherapy are still the first-line treatments for SCLC. However, chemotherapy resistance and systemic toxicity limit the long-term clinical outcome of first-line treatment in SCLC. Recent years, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have made great breakthrough in cancer therapy, and researchers aim to exploit both as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy to improve the survival of SCLC patients, but limited effectiveness and the adverse events remain the major obstacles in the treatment of SCLC. To overcome these challenges for SCLC therapies, prevention and early diagnosis for this refractory disease is very important. At the same time, we should reveal more information about the pathogenesis of SCLC and the mechanism of drug resistance. Finally, new treatment strategies should also be taken into conside...",

Clarithromycin (CAM), a member of the macrolide antibiotics family, is a promising candidate for repurposing in cancer therapy due to its known preclinical and clinical immunomodulatory and anti-cancer properties. In the current study, we investigated whether CAM could be repurposed as a preventive treatment for KRAS-mutant lung cancer, a subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that is strongly associated with heavy smoking. CCSPCre; LSL-KrasG12D mice at an early stage of tumor development were treated with different doses of CAM for 10 weeks. While exhibiting an excellent safety profile, CAM was able to prevent the development of premalignant and malignant lung lesions in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, CAM significantly reduced the infiltration of neutrophils/PMN-MDSCs and inhibited the mRNA...",

Here, we developed a pipeline based on machine learning to predict potential LUAD-related target genes through established graph attention networks (GATs). We then predicted potential drugs for the treatment of LUAD through gene coincidence-based and gene network distance-based methods.

Specially, cancers like small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are difficult to treat even in the normal situation due to their rapid growth and early metastasis. For such patients, treatment can't be compromised and care must be taken to ensure their minimum exposure to the ongoing spread of COVID-19 infection. For this reason, in-house treatments are being suggested for these patients. Another issue is that symptoms of SCLC match well with that of COVID-19 infection. Hence, the detection of COVID-19 may also get delayed leading to unnecessary complications. Thus, we have tried to investigate if the therapeutics that is currently used in lung cancer treatment can also act against SARS-CoV-2. If it is so, the same treatment protocols can be continued even if the SCLC patient had contracted COVID-19 without compromising the cancer care. For this, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from SARS-CoV-2 has been selected ...",

      "abstract": "Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, particularly ABCB1 and ABCG2, strongly correlates with multidrug resistance (MDR), rendering cancer chemotherapy ineffective. Exploration and identification of novel inhibitors targeting ABCB1 and ABCG2 are necessary to overcome the related MDR. Mobocertinib is an approved EGFR/HER2 inhibitor for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. This study demonstrates that mobocertinib can potentially reverse ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR. Our findings indicate a strong interaction between mobocertinib and these two proteins, supported by its high binding affinity with ABCB1 and ABCG2 models. Through inhibiting the drug efflux function of ABCB1 and ABCG2, mobocertinib facilitates substrate drugs accumulation, thereby re-sensitizing substrate drugs in drug-resistant cancer cells. Additionally, mobocertinib inhibited the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 without changing the expression levels or subcellu...",

Therapy intensification is explored with promising, but expensive and potentially toxic new compounds. Repositioning already existing drugs for cancer treatment could save money and improve patient outcomes in specific contexts. Observational data suggest that use of the standard antidiabetic agent metformin decreases lung cancer incidence and mortality. Several basic researches have shown various anticancer effects of metformin, acting both on the glycolytic metabolism and on the tumoral immune microenvironment. Synergistic actions of metformin with antitumoral agents in preclinical NSCLC models have then been highlighted. Recent retrospective studies advocated improved outcomes in NSCLC diabetic patients receiving metformin with chemoradiotherapy or systemic compounds (including conventional platinum-based chem...",

Repurposing the anti-malarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has been proved to possess potent antitumor effect on various cancers. However, the effects of DHA in preventing the invasion of NSCLC cells have not been studied. In the present study, we determined the inhibitory effects of DHA on invasion and migration and the possible mechanisms involved using A549 and H1975 cells. DHA inhibited in vitro migration and invasion of NSCLC cells even in low concentration with little cytotoxicity. Additionally, low concentration DHA also inhibited Warburg effect in NSCLC cells. Mechanically, DHA negatively regulates NF-κB signaling to inhibit the GLUT1 translocation. Blocking the NF-κB signaling largely abolishes the inhibitory effects of DHA on the translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane and the Warburg effect. Furthermore, GLUT1...",

Advances in therapeutics and precise identification of biomarkers can potentially reduce the mortality rate.

Four gene expression profiles (GSE19804, GSE19188, GSE10072, and GSE32863) downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify common differential expressed genes (DEGs). A total of 213 overlapping DEGs (oDEGs) between NSCLC and healthy samples were identified by using statistical LIMMA method. Then 6 common top-ranked key genes (KGs) (CENPF, CAV1, ASPM, CCNB2, PRC1, and KIAA0101) were selected by using four network-measurer methods in the protein- protein interaction network.

Some of the recent studies utilized drug response prediction models to identify drugs that can be repurposed. By representing cell-line features as a pathway-pathway interaction network, we can better understand the connections between cellular processes and drug response mechanisms. Existing deep learning models for drug response prediction do not integrate known biological pathway-pathway interactions into the model. This paper presents a drug response prediction model that applies a graph convolution operation on a pathway-pathway interaction network to represent features of cancer cell-lines effectively. The model is used to identify potential drug repurposing candidates for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

The rapidly increasing understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer is providing new opportunities for early intervention, prior to the development of invasive disease. Furthermore, there is an ever-increasing number of approved drugs with many different mechanisms of action. The appeal of using drugs with well described mechanisms of action and safety profiles has led to renewed interest in repurposing such agents for cancer prevention.

Despite limited clinical trials, there is a continuous effort to investigate thalidomide as a drug for cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lepromatous leprosy, and COVID-19. This review focuses on the possibilities of targeting inflammation by repurposing thalidomide for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Articles were searched from the Scopus database, sorted, and selected articles were reviewed. The content includes the proven mechanisms of action of thalidomide relevant to IPF. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and epigenetic mechanisms are major pathogenic factors in IPF. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is the major biomarker of IPF. Thalidomide is an effective anti-inflammatory drug in inhibiting TGF-β, interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Thalidomide binds cereblon, a process that is involved in the proposed mechan...",

In lung cancer, given the contradictory results obtained, it is crucial to further study its effects. A systematic review of the literature was planned to evaluate a possible beneficial effect of beta-blocker on overall survival in lung cancer patients. Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception until 1 May 2018 to identify published studies that assessed the effect beta-blocker use on overall survival in lung cancer patients. Risk of bias was evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for overall survival were estimated using a random-effects model.

One of the promising approaches is drug repurposing, because it reduces costs and shortens the production cycle of research and development. Disulfiram (DSF), which was originally approved as an anti-alcoholism drug, has been proven safe and shows the potential to target tumours. Its anti-tumour effect has been reported in many preclinical studies and recently on seven types of cancer in humans: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma (GBM) and melanoma and has a successful breakthrough in the treatment of NSCLC and GBM. The mechanisms, particularly the intracellular signalling pathways, still remain to be completely elucidated. As shown in our previous study, DSF inhibits NF-kB signalling, proteasome activity, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. It in...",

However, the molecular mechanisms behind their impact remain unclear. The type III TGF-β receptor (TβR3, also called betaglycan), a co-receptor in the TGF-β superfamily, is often found to be downregulated in various human cancers. This receptor plays a crucial role in suppressing cancer progression and metastasis, independent of TGF-β signaling. In this study, we investigated the effects of ciprofloxacin (a member of FQs) on TβR3 production in cancer cells and their subsequent impact on cancer cell migration and invasion. Our results demonstrated that ciprofloxacin and other FQs dose-dependently elevated TβR3 levels, which was associated with reduced cell migration and invasion.

In the present study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of pimavanserin tartrate (PVT), an antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis. PVT significantly suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis in various pancreatic cancer cells and gemcitabine-resistant cells with minimal effects on normal pancreatic epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts. Growth-suppressive and apoptotic effects of PVT were mediated by the inhibition of the Akt/Gli1 signaling axis. The oral administration of PVT suppressed subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts by 51%-77%. The chronic admini...",

      "abstract": "Bile acids are soluble derivatives of cholesterol produced in the liver that subsequently undergo bacterial transformation yielding a diverse array of metabolites. The bulk of bile acid synthesis takes place in the liver yielding primary bile acids; however, other tissues have also the capacity to generate bile acids (e.g. ovaries). Hepatic bile acids are then transported to bile and are subsequently released into the intestines. In the large intestine, a fraction of primary bile acids is converted to secondary bile acids by gut bacteria. The majority of the intestinal bile acids undergo reuptake and return to the liver. A small fraction of secondary and primary bile acids remains in the circulation and exert receptor-mediated and pure chemical effects (e.g. acidic bile in oesophageal cancer) on cancer cells. In this review, we assess how changes to bile acid biosynthesis, bile acid flux and local bile acid concentration modulate the behavior of different cancers. Here, we present in-d...",

Chemotherapy, as traditional therapy for CRC, has exerted well antitumor effect and greatly improved the survival of CRC patients. Nevertheless, chemoresistance is one of the major problems during chemotherapy for CRC and significantly limits the efficacy of the treatment and influences the prognosis of patients. To overcome chemoresistance in CRC, many strategies are being investigated. Here, we review the common and novel measures to combat the resistance, including drug repurposing (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, metformin, dichloroacetate, enalapril, ivermectin, bazedoxifene, melatonin, and S-adenosylmethionine), gene therapy (ribozymes, RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9, epigenetic therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, and noncoding RNAs), protein inhibitor (EFGR inhibitor, S1PR2 inhibitor, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor), natural herbal compounds (polyphenols, terpenoids, quinones, alkalo...",

TORNADO-seq is a fast, highly reproducible time- and cost-effective ($5 per sample) method that can probe cell mixtures and their differentiation state in the intestinal system. We apply this method to isolate drugs that enrich for differentiated cell phenotypes and show that these drugs are highly efficacious against cancer compared to wild-type organoids.

Combining chemotherapy and phototherapy is an essential multi-modal combination therapy endeavor. Ivermectin (IVM) is a potent antiparasitic agent identified as having potential antitumor properties. However, the fact that it induces protective autophagy while killing tumor cells poses a challenge to its further application. IR780 iodide (IR780) is a near-infrared (NIR) dye with outstanding photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) effects. However, the hydrophobicity, instability, and low tumor uptake of IR780 limit its clinical applications. Here, we have structurally modified IR780 with hydroxychloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, to synthesize a novel compound H780. H780 and IVM can form H780-IVM nanoparticles (H-I NPs) via self-assembly.

It is difficult to diagnose CRC at an early stage as there are no clinical symptoms. Despite advances in molecular biology, only a limited number of biomarkers have been translated into routine clinical practice to predict risk, prognosis and response to treatment. In the last decades, systems biology approaches at the omics level have gained importance. Over the years, several biomarkers for CRC have been discovered in terms of disease diagnosis and prognosis. On the other hand, a few drugs are being developed and used in clinics for the treatment of CRC. However, the development of new drugs is very costly and time-consuming as the research and development takes about 10 years and more than $1 billion. Therefore, drug repositioning (DR) could save time and money by establishing new indications for existing drugs. In this r...",

We therefore evaluated alternative CAR targets already tested in other tumour types and employed the natural killer cell line NK-92 for CAR transduction because of its more favourable toxicity profile. As an alternative antigen, we considered mesothelin (MSLN), the most represented target in CAR-based clinical studies for solid tumours. MSLN RNA expression was analysed in large series of CRC tumours (n = 640) and cell lines (n = 150), to evaluate its distribution and to identify MSLN-overexpressing models. NK-92 cells were transduced with anti-MSLN CAR, and subsequently sorted and cloned. Activity of CAR-NK-92...",

This study employs data mining and consensus molecular subtype (CMS) techniques to identify pitavastatin and atorvastatin as potential agents for targeting high glucose-induced drug resistance in advanced CRC cells. CRC cells maintained under either low or high glucose conditions were established and utilized to assess the cytotoxic effects of pitavastatin and atorvastatin, both with and without 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bacteriostatic antibiotics in regulating the growth potential of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, which differ in their metastatic potential and mitochondrial functions. A combination of viability, cell migration, and spheroid formation assays was used to measure the effect on metastatic potential.

Despite improvement in standardized screening methods and the development of promising therapies, the 5-year survival rates are as low as 10% in the metastatic setting. The increasing life expectancy of the general population, higher rates of obesity, poor diet, and comorbidities contribute to the increasing trends in incidence. Drug repurposing offers an affordable solution to achieve new indications for previously approved drugs that could play a protagonist or adjuvant role in the treatment of CRC with the advantage of treating underlying comorbidities and decreasing chemotherapy toxicity. This review elaborates on the current data that supports drug repurposing as a feasible option for patients with CRC with a focus on the evidence and mechanism of action promising repurposed candidates that are widely used, including but not limited to anti-malarial, anti-helminthic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-hy...",

Accordingly, ferroptosis inducers attracted a lot of interest as potential radio-synergizing drugs, ultimately enhancing radioresponses and patient outcomes. Nevertheless, the tumor microenvironment seems to have a major impact on ferroptosis induction. The influence of hypoxic conditions is an area of interest, as it remains the principal hurdle in the field of radiotherapy. In this review, we focus on the implications of hypoxic conditions on ferroptosis, contemplating the plausibility of using ferroptosis inducers as clinical radiosensitizers. Furthermore, we dive into the prospects of drug repurposing in the domain of ferroptosis inducers and radiosensitizers. Lastly, the potential adverse effects of ferroptosis inducers on normal tissue were discussed in detail. This review will provide an important framework for subsequent ferr...",

There have been numerous attempts to repurpose drugs to tackle this problem. It has been reported that autophagy inducers could augment the effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents by enhancing immunogenic cell death (ICD). In this study, we employed bioinformatics tools to identify thioridazine (THD), an antipsychotic drug, and found that it could induce autophagy and ICD in CRC. Then in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of THD in CRC. THD was found to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in CRC cells by activating the eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP axis and facilitating the accumulation of secretory autophagosomes, leading to ICD. In addition, THD showed a remarkable ICD-activating effect when combined with oxaliplatin (OXA) to prevent tumor progression in the mouse model. Toge...",

The gradual accumulation of genetic and epigenetic processes leads to the establishment of adenoma and cancer. The important 'driver' mutations in tumor suppressor genes (such as TP53, APC, and SMAD4) and oncogenes (such as KRAS, NRAS, MET, and PIK3CA) confer selective growth advantages and cause CRC advancement. Clonal evolution induced by therapeutic pressure, as well as intra-tumoral heterogeneity, has been a great challenge in the treatment of metastatic CRC. Tumors often develop resistance to treatments as a result of intra-tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and selection. Hence, the development of a multidrug personalized approach should be prioritized to pave the way for therapeutics repurposing and combination therapy to arrest tumor progression.

In this study, we found that oxiconazole (OXI), a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, exhibits certain anti-tumor effect against CRC. Autophagy arrest and subsequent apoptosis are characterized as pivotal events involving OXI-induced growth suppression of CRC cells. Mechanistically, OXI downregulates the protein levels of peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), an antioxidant enzyme, for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxication, to initiate autophagy by inactivating the Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibiting RAB7A-mediated fusion of autophagosome and lysosome, which lead to extreme accumulation of autophagosomes and subsequent growth suppression of CRC cells. Consistently, interfering with autophagy or overexpressing PRDX2 significantly impedes OXI-induced growth suppression of CRC cells. Moreover, OXI plus oxaliplatin, a mainstay drug for CRC treatment, achieves an improved anti-tumo...",

Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have various off-target effects, their clinical impact on L-OHP-induced CIPN remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PPIs on L-OHP-induced CIPN in patients using two real-world clinical databases. We retrospectively analyzed the electronic medical records of Osaka University Hospital to examine the effect of PPIs on CIPN development in 217 patients who received XELOX (L-OHP plus capecitabine) therapy for colorectal cancer. In addition, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database was used to validate the effects of PPIs on L-OHP-induced CIPN. The incidences of CIPN (grade ≥2) and discontinuation of L-OHP were significantly lower in patients with PPIs than in those without PPIs. Multivariate analysis showed that concomitant PPIs use w...",

This study aims to explore the role of the SLC4A4 transporter as a biomarker in CRC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in relation to tumor acidity and immune response. The study utilized computational approaches, including receptor-based virtual screening and high-throughput docking, to identify potential SLC4A4 inhibitors.

      "abstract": "Viral malignancies represent a distinct entity among cancers. Oncoviruses like the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) are highly potent inducers of oncogenic transformation leading to tumor development. HPV and EBV are known to be increasingly involved in the pathogenesis of various classes of cancers like cervical, head and neck, colorectal, breast, oral and anogenitial. Therapeutic vaccines directed at such oncoviruses, often fail to unleash the desired immune response against the tumor. This is largely due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the virus-induced tumors. Consequently, metronomic chemotherapies administered in conjunction with therapeutic viral vaccines have considerably enhanced the antitumor activity of these vaccines. Moreover, given the unique attributes of HPV and EBV-associated cancers, therapeutic agents directly targeting the oncoproteins of these viruses are still obscure. In this light, an increasing number of reports have evi...",

Numerous effective anticancer drugs have been developed in the last decade, yet the problem remains due to their low therapeutic index and nonspecificity. A new anticancer therapeutic paradigm is based on repurposing and nanoformulating drugs. Albendazole (ALB), a popular anthelmintic agent, was recently repurposed against CRC cells. In this study zein, an amphiphilic protein, was used to formulate nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with ALB. Box-Behnken design was selected to optimize the loaded NPs, the concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol, acetic acid, and the weight of zein were the independent variables. The dependent variables were the particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. The optimized formula displayed a size of 84.3 ± 0.41 nm, PDI 0.13 ± 0.012, and a zeta potential of 42.5 ± 2.35 mV.

DCV also inhibits the expression of PDL-1, which is responsible for resistance to immunotherapy in breast cancer cells. The demonstrated low toxicity in many Hepatitis C patients suggests LDV and DCV could be used in combination therapies for cancer patients. At the molecular level, these direct-acting antivirals inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and the ephrin type A receptor 2 (EPHA2) by destabilizing a Src-EPHA2 complex, although they do not affect the general kinase activity of Src. Thus, LDV and DCV could be effective drugs for Src-associated cancers without the inherent toxicity of classical Src inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and new treatment options are urgently needed. Drug repositioning has gained attention as a strategy to identify new therapeutic applications for CRC. This approach can expedite drug development and reduce costs by leveraging drugs already undergoing safety testing. Computational and experimental methods are used to identify potential candidates for drug repositioning in CRC. However, challenges such as a lack of comprehensive knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and resolving intellectual property and regulatory issues must be overcome. Drug repositioning has the potential to revolutionize CRC treatment by identifying new drugs for gastrointestinal tumors. For example, metformin, a biguanide antidiabetic drug, is effective for CRC by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. COX-2 inhibitors, which block cyclooxygenase-2 to reduce inflammation and cancer progression, may also be e...",

      "abstract": "xCT overexpression in cancer cells has been linked to tumor growth, metastasis and treatment resistance. Sulfasalazine (SSZ), an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid sarthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, has anticancer properties via inhibition of xCT, leading to the disruption of redox homeostasis. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are pivotal for the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT), elevated levels of ROS are associated with improved RT outcomes. In this study, the influence of SSZ treatment on the radiosensitivity of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was investigated. Our principal finding in human HCT116 and DLD-1 cells was that SSZ enhances the radiosensitivity of hypoxic CRC cells but does not alter the intrinsic radiosensitivity. The radiosensitizing effect was attributed to the depletion of glutathione and thioredoxin reductase levels. In turn, the reduction leads to excessive levels of ROS, increased DNA damage, and ferroptosis induction. Confirmation of ...",

Neddylation plays a pivotal role in the growth and proliferation of animal cells. In colorectal cancer (CRC), it predominantly contributes to the proliferation, metastasis and survival of tumor cells, decreasing overall patient survival. The strategic manipulation of the NEDD8‑mediated neddylation pathway holds immense therapeutic promise in terms of the potential to modulate the growth of tumors by regulating diverse biological responses within cancer cells, such as DNA damage response and apoptosis, among others.

Several studies have reported the promising anticancer effects of sertraline, both alone and combined, in different types of cancer cell lines. Here, we performed a literature review on the anticancer potential of sertraline against different human cancer cells, more specifically in lung, colorectal, breast, hepatocellular, leukemia, brain, skin, oral, ovarian, and prostate cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) was used as a test case for a repurposing workflow based on rFASTCORMICS.

The study encompassed a comprehensive suite of physiological, imaging, histological, and molecular evaluations, substantiating metformin's influence on delaying age-related phenotypes at the organismal level. Specifically, we leveraged pan-tissue transcriptomics, DNA methylomics, plasma proteomics, and metabolomics to develop innovative monkey aging clocks and applied these to gauge metformin's effects on aging. The results highlighted a significant slowing of aging indicators, notably a roughly 6-year regression in brain aging. Metformin exerts a substantial neuroprotective effect, preserving brain structure and enhancing cognitive ability. The geroprotective effects on primate neurons were partially mediated by the activation of Nrf2, a transcription factor with anti-oxidative capabilities. Our research pioneers the systemic ...",

Primarily being an antihyperglycemic agent, metformin also has a plethora of pleiotropic effects on various systems and processes. It acts majorly by activating AMPK (Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase) in the cells and reducing glucose output from the liver. It also decreases advanced glycation end products and reactive oxygen species production in the endothelium apart from regulating the glucose and lipid metabolism in the cardiomyocytes, hence minimizing the cardiovascular risks. Its anticancer, antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on malignant cells might prove instrumental in the malignancy of organs like the breast, kidney, brain, ovary, lung, and endometrium.

AMPK is directly activated by an increase in AMP:ATP ratio in metabolic stress conditions including hypoxia and glucose deprivation. Lately, many novel pathways, besides AMPK induction, have been revealed, which can explain some of metformin's beneficial effects. It may help to identify new targets for treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, metformin is now attracting the attention of researchers in fields other than diabetes, as it has been shown to have anti-cancer, immunoregulatory and anti-aging effects. The aim of this review is to describe the potential anti-cancer and anti-aging properties of metformin and discuss the possible underlying mechanisms.",

An accumulation of positive pre-clinical and clinical data has stimulated interest in re-purposing metformin to treat a variety of diseases including COVID-19. In polycystic ovary syndrome metformin improves insulin sensitivity. In type 1 diabetes metformin may help reduce the insulin dose. Meta-analysis and data from pre-clinical and clinical studies link metformin to a reduction in the incidence of cancer. Clinical trials, including MILES (Metformin In Longevity Study), and TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin), have been designed to determine if metformin can offset aging and extend lifespan.

Obesity and diabetes are now recognized as risk factors for several types of malignancies, especially endometrial, colorectal, and postmenopausal breast cancers. Mechanisms implicated include disturbances in lipid-derived hormone secretion, sex steroids biosynthesis, hyperinsulinemia, and chronic inflammation. Intentional weight loss is associated with a mitigation of risk for obesity-related cancers, a phenomenon observed specially with bariatric surgery. The impact of pharmacological interventions for obesity and diabetes is not uniform: while metformin seems to protect against cancer, other agents such as lorcaserin may increase the risk of malignancies. However, these interpretations must be carefully considered, since most data stem from bias-prone observational studies, and high-quality randomized controlled trials with appropriate sa...",

However, the functions and detailed mechanisms of metformin's role in cancer immunity are not fully understood. Here, we show that metformin increases CTL activity by reducing the stability and membrane localization of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Furthermore, we discover that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activated by metformin directly phosphorylates S195 of PD-L1. S195 phosphorylation induces abnormal PD-L1 glycosylation, resulting in its ER accumulation and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Consistently, tumor tissues from metformin-treated breast cancer patients exhibit reduced PD-L1 levels with AMPK activation. Blocking the inhibitory signal of PD-L1 by metformin enhances CTL activity against cancer cells. Our findings identify a new regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 expression through the ERAD pathway and suggest that the metformin-CTLA4 b...",

SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, plays multiple roles in inflammatory response and immunity. Metformin can activate SIRT1 to participate in different biological processes and exert its anticancer effects. However, the mechanism by which metformin activates SIRT1 to drive cancer cell pyroptosis has not been reported. In this study, we treated cancer cells with metformin for diverse periods of time (0-24 h) and found that cell viability was decreased obviously. Interestingly, pyroptosis occurred when cancer cells were treated with metformin for the indicated time (4, 8 and 12 h), which was elucidated by the cell swelling and bubbles blowing in the membrane. Metformin also increased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, an indication of pyroptotic cell cytotoxicity) remarkably. The underlying mechanisms were that metformin enhanced AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and further increased NF-κB ...",

There is a well-documented correlation between glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression and the level of IR. Therefore, the observed increase in peripheral glucose utilization after metformin treatment most likely comes from the induction of GLUT4 expression and its increased translocation to the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms behind this effect and the critical metformin targets are still largely undefined. The present review explores the evidence for the crucial role of changes in the expression and activation of insulin signaling pathway mediators, AMPK, several GLUT4 translocation mediators, and the effect of posttranscriptional modifications based on previously published preclinical and clinical models of metformin's mode of action in animal and human studies.

      "abstract": "Metformin users appear to have a substantially lower risk of cancer than nonusers in many observational studies. These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial. We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Among individual...",

      "abstract": "Due to the strong association between diabetes and cancer incidents, several anti-diabetic drugs, including metformin, have been examined for their anticancer activity. Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent used as a first-line drug for type II diabetes mellitus. It exhibits anticancer activity by impacting different molecular pathways, such as AMP-inducible protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent and AMPK-independent pathways. Additionally, Metformin indirectly inhibits IGF-1R signaling, which is highly activated in breast malignancy. On the other hand, breast cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, where the human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive (HER2-positive) subtype is one of the most aggressive ones with a high rate of lymph node metastasis. In this review, we summarize the association between diabetes and human cancer, listing recent evidence of metformin's anticancer activity. A special focus is dedicated to HER2-posit...",

Metformin has been shown to protect against PCOS by reducing insulin resistance in women, whereas its role in OGC pyroptosis is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the impact of metformin on OGC pyroptosis and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that treating a human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN) with metformin significantly decreased LPS-induced expression of miR-670-3p, NOX2, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, and GSDMD-N. Cellular caspase-1 activity; ROS production; oxidative stress; and the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α were also diminished. These effects were amplified by adding N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a pharmacological inhibitor of ROS. In contrast, metformin's anti-pyroptosis and anti-inflammatory effects were robustly ameliorated by NOX2 overexp...",

      "abstract": "Metformin is a lipophilic biguanide which inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and improves peripheral utilization of glucose. It is the first line pharmacotherapy for glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes due to its safety, efficacy and tolerability. Metformin exhibits pleotropic effects, which may have beneficial effects on a variety of tissues independent of glucose control. A potential anti-tumourigenic effect of metformin may be mediated by its role in activating AMP-kinase, which in turn inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Non-AMPK dependent protective pathways may include reduction of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, leptin, inflammatory pathways and potentiation of adiponectin, all of which may have a role in tumourigenesis. A role in inhibiting cancer stem cells is also postulated. A number of large scale observational and cohort studies suggest metformin is associated with a reduced risk of a number of cancers, although the data is not conclusive. Rece...",

Anti-hyperglycemic treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus that induce hyperinsulinemia (i.e., sulfonylureas) are thought to increase cancer risk, whereas treatments that lower insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (i.e., metformin) are considered cancer prevention strategies. Metformin is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. Retrospective studies have shown a survival benefit in diabetic patients with many solid tumors including pancreatic cancer that have been treated with metformin compared with patients treated with insulin or sulfonylureas.

The purpose of this review is to examine metformin's chemopreventive potential by outlining relevant mechanisms of action, the most recent epidemiologic evidence, and recently completed and ongoing clinical trials. Although repurposing drugs with excellent safety profiles is an appealing strategy for cancer prevention and treatment in the adjuvant setting, there is no substitute for well-executed, large randomised clinical trials to define efficacy and determine the populations that are most likely to benefit from an intervention.

Retrospective studies associate the use of metformin with a reduction in cancer incidence and cancer-related death. However, despite extensive research about the molecular effects of metformin in cancer cells, its mode of action remains controversial. In this review, we summarize the current molecular evidence in an effort to elucidate metformin's mode of action against cancer cells. Some authors describe that metformin acts directly on mitochondria, inhibiting complex I and restricting the cell's ability to cope with energetic stress. Furthermore, as the drug interrupts the tricarboxylic acid cycle, metformin-induced alteration of mitochondrial function leads to a compensatory increase in lactate and glycolytic ATP. It has also been reported that cell cycle arrest, autophagy, apoptosis and cell death induction is mediated...",

The biguanide seems to directly impair cancer energy asset, with the consequent phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibiting cell proliferation and tumor growth. This action is most often attributed to a well-documented blockage of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) caused by a direct interference of metformin on Complex I function. Nevertheless, several other pleiotropic actions seem to contribute to the anticancer potential of this biguanide. In particular, in vitro and in vivo experimental studies recently documented that metformin selectively inhibits the uptake of 2-[18F]-Fluoro-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (FDG), via an impaired catalytic function of the enzyme hexose-6P-dehydrogenase (H6PD).

This review also discussed the latest developments in metformin nanoformulations and their enhanced anticancer effects and the feasibility of using nanoformulation to deliver metformin with its limitations and challenges. In the current review article, we compiled previously reported studies on metformin's anticancer properties and nanoformulations by searching them in commonly used electronic databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, etc. In many research investigations, it has been reported that metformin (oral antidiabetic drug commonly employed in the clinical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus...",

      "abstract": "Metformin administration has recently emerged as a candidate strategy for the prevention of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the intricate relationship between genetic alterations in HNSCC and metformin sensitivity is still poorly understood, which prevents the stratification of patients, harboring oral premalignant lesions that may benefit from the chemopreventive activity of metformin. In this study, we investigate the impact of prevalent mutations in HNSCC on response to metformin. Notably, we found that the expression of oncogenic HRAS mutants confers resistance to metformin in isogenic HNSCC cell systems, and that HNSCC cells harboring endogenous HRAS mutations display limited sensitivity to metformin. Remarkably, we found that metformin fails to reduce activation of the mTOR pathway in HRAS oncogene-expressing HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo, correlating with reduced tumor suppressive activity. Mechanistically, we found that this process depends on the abi...",

      "abstract": "Metformin is currently a strong candidate anti-tumor agent in multiple cancers. However, its anti-tumor effectiveness varies among different cancers or subpopulations, potentially due to tumor heterogeneity. It thus remains unclear which hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient subpopulation(s) can benefit from metformin treatment. Here, through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout screen, we find that DOCK1 levels determine the anti-tumor effects of metformin and that DOCK1 is a synthetic lethal target of metformin in HCC. Mechanistically, metformin promotes DOCK1 phosphorylation, which activates RAC1 to facilitate cell survival, leading to metformin resistance. The DOCK1-selective inhibitor, TBOPP, potentiates anti-tumor activity by metformin in vitro in liver cancer cell lines and patient-derived HCC organoids, and in vivo in xenografted liver cancer cells and immunocompetent mouse liver cancer models. Notably, metformin improves overall survival of HCC patients with low DOCK1 lev...",

Epidemiological studies first recognized a relationship with metformin use in T2DM patients and reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Thereafter, metformin has gained wide attention as a candidate CRC chemopreventative agent; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its gastrointestinal anti-cancer properties appear multi-faceted and are not well understood. An intriguing area of research is the growing evidence of metformin's metabolic juncture with gut microbiota at the intestinal mucosal interface.

A series of clinical observations of the last decades, support that metformin may contribute to lowering the risk of cancer development in diabetic patients, and also to improvement of response-to-therapy and survival in individuals with certain types of malignancies. Moreover, several preclinical in vitro and in vivo data indicate that metformin indeed exerts anti-proliferative capacities upon tumor cells mediated through a variety of mechanisms. Interestingly, metformin has been shown to act in synergy with certain anti-cancer agents and also to overcome chemo- and/or radio-resistance of various types of tumors, providing a hopeful rationale for novel therapeutic strategies against cancer development and progression. However, this remains an issue of controversy, since significant contradictions exist among the available data. Limitati...",

Most of these cancers develop on a background of overweight or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). One of the medications widely used in the treatment of T2DM is biguanide derivative, metformin, which exerts promising anticancer properties principally through activation of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Many epidemiological studies on diabetic patients show potential preventative role of metformin in endometrial cancer patients, but data regarding its therapeutic role is still limited. So far, most of attention has been paid to the concept of metformin use in fertility sparing treatment of early-stage cancer. Another investigated alternative is its application in patients with primary advanced or recurrent disease.

It was also demonstrated that the large variety of metformin's vascular actions can be seen in nondiabetic conditions. Metformin has an interesting potential to treat vascular dysfunction and tumor angiogenesis in conditions beyond diabetes. Since metformin's use in cancer as a single antiangiogenic agent appears to be a therapeutic disappointment, the use of the drug as part of combination anticancer modality represents a therapeutic challenge. The normalization of vascular dysfunction as a new therapeutic strategy may provide better delivery of conventional anticancer agents to the tumor and disrupted tumor environment.

A systematic data extraction and bias assessment was conducted, in which risk of eight bias domains (outcome, exposure, control selection, baseline confounding, time-dependent confounding, immortal time, missing data, censoring methods) were assessed against pre-defined criteria, and rated as unlikely, low, medium or high. Of 46 studies identified, 21 assessed the effect of metformin on all cancer.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated a number of antineoplastic biological effects via a range of molecular mechanisms. Data from retrospective epidemiological studies in prostate cancer has been mixed; however, there are several clinical trials currently underway evaluating metformin's role as an anti-cancer agent.

      "abstract": "Metformin and IACS-010759 are two distinct antimetabolic agents. Metformin, an established antidiabetic drug, mildly inhibits mitochondrial complex I, while IACS-010759 is a new potent mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. Mitochondria is pivotal in the energy metabolism of cells by providing adenosine triphosphate through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Hence, mitochondrial metabolism and OXPHOS become a vulnerability when targeted in cancer cells. Both drugs have promising antitumoral effects in diverse cancers, supported by preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies. We present evidence of their direct impact on cancer cells and their immunomodulatory effects. In clinical studies, while observational epidemiologic studies on metformin were encouraging, actual trial results were not as expected. However, IACS-01075 exhibited major adverse effects, thereby causing a metabolic shift to glycolysis and elevated lactic acid concentrations. Therefore, the future outlook for these two drugs ...",

      "abstract": "Currently, tamoxifen is the only drug approved for reduction of breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. The significant cardiovascular side effects of tamoxifen, coupled with lack of a survival benefit, potential for genotoxicity, and failure to provide a significant risk-reduction for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, all contribute to the low acceptance of tamoxifen chemoprevention in premenopausal women at high-risk for breast cancer. While other prevention options exist for postmenopausal women, there is a search for well-tolerated prevention agents that can simultaneously reduce risk of breast cancers, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Metformin is a well-tolerated oral biguanide hypoglycemic agent that is prescribed worldwide to over 120 million individuals with type-2 diabetes. Metformin is inexpensive, safe during pregnancy, and the combination of metformin, healthy lifestyle, and exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing diabetes. There is a g...",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer metastasis remain unclear. Colorectal cancer cell lines were treated with metformin, and cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were analyzed in vitro. The relationship between metformin and the AMPK-mTOR axis was assessed by Western blot analysis and transfection with small interfering RNA. A colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model was used to observe the effects of metformin on liver metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on liver metastatic tumors. In in vitro experiments, metformin significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion only in HCT116 and SW837 cells, but not in HCT8 and Lovo cells.

Many antidiabetes treatments, particularly metformin, enhance insulin signaling, but this pathway can be inhibited by specific cancer treatments. The modulation of cancer growth by metformin and of insulin sensitivity by anticancer drugs is so common that this phenomenon is being studied in hundreds of clinical trials on cancer. Many meta-analyses have consistently shown a moderate but direct effect of body mass index on the incidence of multiple myeloma and lymphoma and the elevated risk of leukemia in adults. Moreover, new epidemiological and preclinical studies indicate metformin as a therapeutic agent in patients with leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma.

      "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most dangerous gynecologic cancers worldwide, showing a high fatality rate and recurrence due to diagnosis at an advanced stage of the disease and the occurrence of chemoresistance, which weakens the therapeutic effects of the chemotherapeutic treatments. In fact, although paclitaxel and platinum-based drugs (carboplatin or cisplatin) are widely used alone or in combination to treat ovarian cancer, the occurrence of chemoresistance significantly reduces the effects of these drugs. Metformin is a hypoglycemic agent that is commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, this drug also shows anti-tumor activity, reducing cancer risk and chemoresistance. This review analyzes the current literature regarding the role of metformin in ovarian cancer and investigates what is currently known about its effects in reducing paclitaxel and platinum resistance to restore sensitivity to these drugs.",

Inadvertently perhaps, among the millions of type 2 diabetics with occult or known cancers and who have been prescribed metformin since the 1950s, thousands may have benefited from the anticancer properties of this first-line pharmacotherapy. Quo vadis? Now, researchers aim to move metformin from a non-targeted stage of cancer therapy that has been mostly developed retrospectively and empirically into a targeted therapy by following a biological rationale and a predefined mechanism of action. But, who might benefit from metformin? Cui bono? Because metformin is on the leading edge of a new generation of cancer metabolism-targeted therapies, perhaps it is the right time to provide solutions to the challenges that metformin and other onco-biguanides will face in the coming years before becoming incorporated into the therapeutic armamentarium against cancer.",

Metformin treatment failure may be attributed to the high frequency of transcriptional dysregulation, which leads to drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found evidences that metformin resistance in PCa cells may be linked to cell cycle reactivation. Super-enhancers (SEs), crucial regulatory elements, have been shown to be associated with drug resistance in various cancers. Our analysis of SEs in metformin-resistant (MetR) PCa cells revealed a correlation with Prostaglandin Reductase 1 (PTGR1) expression, which was identified as significantly increased in a cluster of cells with metformin resistance through single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Our functional experiments showed that PTGR1 overexpression accelerated cell cycle progression by promoting progression from the G0/G1 to the S and G2/M phases, resulting in reduced ...",

Genetic variation in metformin metabolism pathways appears to modify metformin glycemic control and the protective association with some cancers. However, no studies to date have examined this pharmacogenetic interaction and prostate cancer chemoprevention. Clinical data and germline DNA were collected from our prostate biopsy database between 1996 and 2014. In addition to a genome-wide association study (GWAS), 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated in metformin metabolism were included on a custom SNP array. Associations between metformin use and risk of high-grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) and overall prostate cancer were explored using a case-control design. Interaction between the candidate/GWAS SNPs and the metformin-cancer association was explored using a case-only design. Among 3481 men, 132 (4%) were taking metformin at diagnosis.

Metformin reduces DNA damage by mechanisms that are only incompletely understood. Metformin scavenges free radicals, including reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, which are produced by genotoxicants such as ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, heavy metals, and chemotherapeutic agents. The drug may also increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes and inhibit NADPH oxidase, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, thereby limiting macrophage recruitment and inflammatory responses. Metformin stimulates the DNA damage response (DDR) in the homologous end-joining, homologous recombination, and nucleotide excision repair pathways.

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Although some epidemiological studies have shown an inverse relationship between the use of metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, and the incidence of lung cancer, the real benefits of the drug are unclear as the efficacy is low and the outcomes are quite heterogeneous. To develop a more potent form of metformin, we synthesized mitochondria-targeted metformin (mitomet) and tested its efficacy in in vitro and in vivo models of lung cancer. Mitomet was cytotoxic to transformed bronchial cells and several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines but relatively safe to normal bronchial cells, and these effects were mediated mainly via induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Studies using isogenic A549 cells showed that mitomet was selectively toxic to those cells deficient in the tumor suppressor gene LKB1, which is widely mutated in NSCLC. Mitomet also significantly reduced the multip...",

Many retrospective data and laboratory studies suggest the idea that metformin has antineoplastic activity, but some other studies reach conflicting conclusions. Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which metformin affects various cancers have not been fully elucidated, activation of AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent pathways along with energy metabolism aberration, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis or autophagy induction have emerged as crucial regulators in this process. In this Review, we describe the role of metformin in the prevention and treatment of a variety of cancers and summarize the molecular mechanisms that are currently well documented in the ability of metformin as an anticancer agent. In addition, the scientific and clinical hurdles regarding the potential role of metformin in cancer will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear chromatin protein overexpressed in various cancers and linked to tumor progression. Outside the cell, HMGB1 binds to receptors such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), promoting metastasis. Targeting this signaling pathway may provide a new therapeutic strategy for aggressive cancers. Metformin, a well-established antidiabetic drug, directly interacts with HMGB1, inhibiting its pro-inflammatory functions. This study investigates metformin's effects on the HMGB1/RAGE signaling pathway in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Using wound-healing and colony formation assays, we demonstrate that metformin reduces HMGB1-induced cell migration and proliferation. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses reveal that metformin decreases RAGE stabilization on the cell membrane, disrupts NF-κB signaling, and reverses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing E-cadherin, reducing vimentin, and sta...",

Moreover, statin use after GI cancer diagnosis has been significantly associated with better prognosis in large-scale cohort studies.

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancers are characterized by frequent alterations in the PI3K-AKT-mTor, IGF1 and DNA repair signaling pathways. Concomitant inhibition of these pathways was warranted. ENDOLA phase I/II trial (NCT02755844) was designed to assess the safety/efficacy of the triplet combination of the PARP inhibitor olaparib, metronomic cyclophosphamide (50 mg daily), and PI3K-AKT-mTor inhibitor metformin (1500 mg daily) in women with recurrent endometrial carcinomas. Olaparib dose-escalation (100-300 mg twice-a-day (bid)) was used to determine the recommended-phase II-trial-dose (RP2D, primary endpoint), followed by an expansion cohort to determine the non-progression rate at 10 weeks (NPR-10w, secondary endpoint). 31 patients were treated. Olaparib RP2D was defined as 300 mg bid. The tolerability was acceptable, and grade 3-4 adverse events (51% patients) were mainly hematological. The NPR-10w was 61.5%, and the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 5.2 months. In a post-hoc analysis, ...",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents the most adverse prognosis due to its pronounced invasive and metastatic features. Existing research has highlighted that metformin, a prevalent diabetes medication, possesses strong anti-tumor properties, particularly in inhibiting tumor invasion and metastasis. This study delves deeper into the impact of metformin on TNBC by examining changes in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and adhesion of TNBC cells, specifically MDA-MB-231, post-metformin exposure. The treatment of MDA-MB-231 with metformin in immunodeficient nude mice led to discernible changes in tumor metrics such as size, weight, lymph node engagement, and angiogenesis. Post-treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a marked decline in proliferation, invasion, migration, and adhesion, alongside a significant rise in apoptosis. In the in vivo model with nude mice, tumors displayed notable reductions in size and weight post-metformin exposure. Furthermore, there was a pr...",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for various cancers, with the impact of anti-diabetic therapies on cancer progression differing across malignancies. Among these therapies, metformin has gained attention for its potential anti-cancer effects, primarily through modulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathway and the induction of autophagy. Beyond metformin, other conventional anti-diabetic treatments, such as insulin, sulfonylureas (SUs), pioglitazone, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, have also been examined for their roles in cancer biology, though findings are often inconclusive. More recently, novel medications, like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, have revolutionized DM management by not only improving glycemic control but also delivering substantial cardio...",
